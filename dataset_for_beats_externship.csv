R1TNTONRLTPEWR,B09FM6PDHP,5.0 out of 5 stars Raycons better up their game if they wanna compete.,Dawson,5,Before I bought these I had raycons. Raycon earbuds are absolute trash. The feel was cheap and they broke after dropping them. The sound was eh but absolute trash. I had to use the warranty to get a new pair and same issue. I had to eventually buy a new pair and I decided I wouldn't ever buy raycons again and since these were on sale for $60 I decided to give them a shot. I knew JBL was a great speaker and headphones brand so I wanted to give them a try. Omg they are the best earbuds I've ever had. They're so easy to connect to ur phone and you can change the sound profile from the app. The sound cancellation is like nothing I've ever had even better somehow than my gaming headphones I think. The bass is unreal!!! The sound clarity and everything is incredible. Best earbuds I've ever had. They are durable too. They feel like good quality and the case is perfect. It feels good it snaps shut and has a good satisfying feel and sound when it does. It fits perfectly in my pocket and the charge life is so fricken long I can go a week without charging it and it still has life. I've had these for about a month and only charged them maybe twice. I'm so happy with the way these are id highly suggest buying these. Especially over raycon earbuds. I'm so happy I helped people not waste their money on that crappy brand. Someone I talked to even canceled their order to buy a pair of these and thanked me because these were on sale for way cheaper. But even at base price for only a few dollars more why not buy quality? If you want the best earbuds I'd say on the market ....buy these. It's cheap for the experience and quality your getting.,"Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AGI3WTFII3HB6JI2GL5PM7J7F7DQ,1,54,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones
R11OSJ184YK5L8,B09FM6PDHP,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality,Amazon Customer,5,"This review is representative of my first impressions after receiving the item.Fit - 4/5: While I've had better fitting earbuds in the past, I would say that these aren't problematic at all, but not perfect either. The buds fit fairly snugly in my ears, and its quite nice that they've included a few tips. They don't seem to move around if I shake my head, so I have decent confidence that if I take them to the gym or on a run, I wouldn't have problems. That said, they don't quite fit perfectly, but everyones ear is a bit different so others might find it better or worse.Sound - 5/5: All I can say is wow do I love the sound that these produce. The level of bass is far beyond anything that I've had from my other earbuds (Jabra Elite 65t and Jlabs JBuds Air). The app includes equalizer settings that actually make quite a lot of difference (unlike other headphone apps I have used) and I am blown away by how much bass can come from these headphones. I have also noticed with other wireless buds that they tend to be on the quiet side, not reaching the same volume that my larger Sony headphones can, but that is not at all the case here. These get LOUD. As someone who plans to mainly use these for workouts, this is exactly what I hoped for.Battery - 5/5: So far I have not had a chance to use these until they die, so I have to disclaim that. However, if the battery matches up or comes close to their claims, which I expect they will given it is a reputable brand, then I will be impressed. My other buds max out at around 8 hours, so getting almost 4x the total battery life is excellent. 8 hours without recharging is very impressive.Look and feel - 3/5: The case looks nice and I think the aesthetics are fine. But the buds themselves are polished smooth, which makes them a bit tricky to handle with your fingertips. Once they're in, its no problem. But a matte finish or some texture would have been better for usability.I'll update this review if I find any reason to, but I am extremely impressed by the headphones, especially for the price point. Highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AHDFGIHZLAWNS6GVEJFT6HO4JONQ,1,18,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones
R2ND8UB3QKR4XD,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars JBL for the win.,Amber,4,"Affordable, and great all arounder. Noise cancelling is great, they fit in my ears well which I usually have trouble with. The quick start guide helped a ton figuring out all the controls, which is a must for me as I find I have a lot trouble figuring these types of things out. I think there is even an app that you can change the commands which is pretty cool! So they get an A plus for adjustability in that regard.I love the color, I chose navy but there many to choose from. I havent used them much for phone calls yet, but they pick up the wind a lot so Ive chosen not to use them for most of my phone calls when Ive had them in.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AHKSTPYCQ256XNBIJJNN5IKNF43A,1,1,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones
R1ATLW9X08QUD0,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, comfortable in the ears",Rusty Squeezebox,5,"Took a chance and bought these on prime day, pleasantly surprised with the quality compared to the jlab buds I've been using for years. Again very happy with the quality but more importantly for me is the battery life, these are very comparable with the higher end jlab buds that will last me the entire work day and have enough juice in the case so that I'm not having to charge them multiple times a week. These are amazing in both categories. And lastly you can listen to each bud independently which is a must for people like me that usually only wear one. So In the off chance one dies you just pop in the other one and your good to go for another 8 hours.","Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2024",AGYXE4BIFF7ICA2CNQ27K5VYPBCQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones
R1PDE5V244R06D,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars At 50% or more off, these are great.",Dru Ha,5,"I have one pair for work and one for home/going out. I wouldnt have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair theyre a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds. Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3s. Im an audiophile on a budget. They cant compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds theyre a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. Ive found the bass to be a little lacking but I think thats due to the EQ setting Ive selected. You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I havent found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the ambient-aware or talk through modes. Thats a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which dont seem to have any functional ANC. I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. Theyll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1. However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc. its a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I dont want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2023",AFUR62MXQUALQJX5LDFW3KOQBQLA,1,99,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones
R2U2NHW73XC78Y,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Right earbud stopped working&,Zoe,3,"I bought these JBL earbuds in March (its July now) as a cheap replacement for my lost AirPods and I absolutely fell in love with them. These things really get me through the day with their ambient sound control, great sound quality and omg talk about battery life! This being said&.About a month ago my right earbud started having connectivity issues with my Bluetooth (while my left earbud functions normally) and now has completely lost the ability to gain charge. So Ive basically been down to one earbud which doesnt allow any of the ambient sound controls and is honestly kind of annoying!I really never write reviews for anything, but Im genuinely devastated because I loved these JBL earbuds so much and I really needed these to last me longer than 5 months. I hate leaving a bad review, but I dont want anyone to potentially face this issue!","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AG66FPQD36HMNUGRE2UY45HZS4QQ,1,4,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones
R3U67WG7KC37BZ,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wow, these are good sounding earbuds",Mike,5,"There are review sites around that test headphones and earbuds and as far accuracy in frequency response and imaging, these earbuds outrank most other brand's more expensive earbuds.I have the JBL Tune 600BTNC headphones which are a great over the ear headphones and these earbuds sound just as good and even a bit clearer. That's hard to do. Both, these 230NC and the 600BTNC have bass between 20Hz and 100Hz elevated by 3db to 5db, the 230NC being a bit more accurate. That's Ok because I like my bass a few decibels higher.These earbuds have really good punch as well as ultra low bass down to 20HZ. Comparing these 230NC to your subwoofer is a great way to see how good or weak your subwoofer is. Since these 230NC earbuds are accurate from 20Hz to 60Hz within 1db or +4db above 100Hz, most subwoofers can't provide the bass these earbuds can.The clarity in the midrange and treble is great, and without elevation to make music sound bright and fatiguing.I have tried the JBL Club Pro Plus and Tune 125TWS and neither would seal correctly or be comfortable to wear more than 10 minutes. Mainly because of the big club at the end of the actual ear piece. Those earbuds don't fit good in every ear because they are big. The 230NC doesn't have club at the end of the earpiece but a small thin stalk like most ""wired"" earbuds that fit everyone good. These 230NC with their long thin stalks fit my ears good and seal good, plus they are actually more comfortable than my 600BTNC headphones. The Club Pro Plus actually hurt my ears and left them in pain for an hour after only wearing them for 10 minutes.These 230NC earbuds sound great, seal good, and are comfortable enough to wear for hours. I don't see doing any better than some $300 earbuds or headphone for sound quality.The one thing they fall down in and so do my 600BTNC is that they use the lower class active noise cancelling instead of the adaptive noise canceling. Honestly they sound great even in a noisy plant with the active noise cancelling.For the price slashing Amazon does to the retail price, they are a bargain IMO.The only thing I wish they had was function to test if they are sealed correctly like the Club Pro Plus had in it's app. That way you know you are getting the maximum bass response that these earbuds can produce. I simply test using music with ultra low bass that I'm very familiar with.","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2023",AF7UFK3GWNSBHUXMPCXJM5LZIKJA,1,38,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones
R21G2QA3DWXAWV,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars A satisfactory pair of earbuds with a decent attempt at noise cancellation,Tonigiri,4,"In this review, I will compare the jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds with some of the best wireless earbuds of 2023, based on four criteria: noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, and design.Noise cancellation: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have active noise cancellation, which works well in most situations, but may not be effective in very loud environments. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with outstanding noise-canceling performance that adapts to your surroundings and personal preferences. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also excellent, with adjustable noise cancellation levels and a transparency mode. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is another good option, with effective noise cancellation and spatial audio support.Sound quality: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds deliver a decent sound quality, with a balanced and clear output. However, they may not satisfy audiophiles who prefer a more detailed and dynamic sound. The Technics EAH-AZ80 wireless earbuds are the best in this category in my opinion, with a superb sound quality that rivals some of the best over-ear headphones. They have a rich and balanced sound signature, with deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. They also support high-resolution audio codecs and have a dedicated app for EQ customization. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are also great, with a dynamic and engaging sound that can be tweaked via the Sony Headphones Connect app. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also impressive, with a top-notch sound quality that is well-balanced and natural. Keep in mind that the jbl 230 nc sits in a very different price point than the earbuds above so it's still punching way above its weight in this regard.Battery life: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a battery life of about four hours, which is average for wireless earbuds. They come with a charging case that can provide an additional 12 hours of playback. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with a battery life of up to eight hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 24 hours with the charging case. They also have a quick charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just 10 minutes of charging. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 are also good, with a battery life of up to six hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 30 hours with the charging case. They also support wireless charging and have a fast charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just five minutes of charging.Design: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a simple and sleek design, with a matte black finish and a jbl logo on each earbud. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear, with three sizes of silicone ear tips to choose from. They are also water-resistant, which means they can withstand sweat and rain. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is the best in this category, with a sleek and ergonomic design that fits snugly in your ears. They have an open design without tips, which means they don't block out the outside sound completely. They also have force sensors on each stem that let you control music playback, calls, noise cancellation, and voice assistants. The Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds are also stylish and comfortable, with a winged design that keeps them secure in your ears. They have an IPX4 rating for water resistance and have touch controls on each earbud.Conclusion: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds are a decent pair of headphones for casual listeners who want to escape the noise of the world. However, they are not the best in any category, and they face stiff competition from other models that offer better performance and features. If you want the best noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, or design, you may want to consider other options such as the Sony WF-1000XM5, the Technics EAH-AZ80, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2, or the Apple AirPods Pro 2. At this price point however, which is often lower (I bought mine on sale for 50% off), the jbl 230 nc is a no-brainer and will give you a value you can't say no to.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AEFYG6AEEKPWIUMDM2IYUSDK2FLA,1,140,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphones
R1PQYT04HC2P7L,B09FM6PDHP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Had high hopes, jury is still out.",Shonna,4,"I bought these to replace my skullcandy sesh Evo. I had the skillcandy for over a year & recently I lost the left bud & then the right ear bud decided it was gonna be finicky about charging. Like the sensor wasn't connecting properly anymore. It was getting super frustrating because I only had 1 ear bud left & when I wanted to use it it would either be dead or only give me a few minutes. After watching many reviews on YouTube & reading them here I decided I'd get these JBL ones as they had good reviews & *bonus* they were on sale for $49.00. I am on day 3 of using them. Around my house I normally only wear 1 ear bud so I can still keep an ear on my kids. I used the right ear bud all day yesterday, sticking it back in the case when not in use. Last night I went to use the left ear bud & it didn't automatically connect when I took it out like the right one. When I had both out it connected so I put the right back in the case. When I woke up this morning I went to use the left one & the app said it only had 20% battery even though it was in the charger all night. In messing with them I realized even in the case the left was still connected & playing. I finally got it to connect to the charger & work properly. But I feel like it shouldn't be this difficult. It's not rocket science placing the ear buds in the case. I am using these for music, podcasts, & watching shows. The sound is great. I haven't made calls with them. They fit comfortably in my ear, I like the black sleek color. I am just hoping I don't continue to have charging or connection issues as I will use these EVERY SINGLE DAY all throughout the day.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AEB4PHJN3LWFAU3TMAW2QU6XRTIQ,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones

I love them they connect instantly, the durability only time will tell. The comfort, they are extremely comfortable =.Volume control I'll group the rating of the different ""be aware"" controls here the ambient be aware is like your traditional be aware you can listen to music while also hearing your surroundings a little but but the voice be aware setting turns your music down and allows you to listen while also hearing most everything around you with good clarity. The noise canceling I'll tell you how good it is: I ride public transportation a d our roads in the city is not good so it makes the bus rattle when it goes over the bumps and it canceled that loud noise out to about 20-30% of the original sound.

RU17Y1H4GO22E,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars Worked great...for just short of 2 years,Quicksilvur,4,"I think I spent at least $100 on these back in September '22. I wanted to replace a former set of earbuds with something more substantial and higher quality. I really love all that JBL does (I have purchased their FLIP bluetooth speaker as well and it's fantastic).However, for some reason, everything just crashed and burned suddenly. First, the left earbud stopped charging altogether (no light shows up even after cleaning the contacts). Then the charging case went entirely dead after just charging it to 100%. So I'm figuring it's the end. Sadly.I had figured a mid-priced brand would be a nice middle ground (somewhere between Tribit and Bose lol). I am not a power user and am very careful with my earbuds, so maybe this was just as long as these were going to live. I will keep buying JBL, but have to unfortunately add my voice of disappointment on these earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AEEKDCHLNPFK4YGNYN6QNS3JLYSA,1,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones

I mean, for something so small to be able to block out so much noise is just quite unbelievable.In addition, the Ambient Aware mode is quite amazing as well, as you can literally hear everything around you, while still hearing the music quite clearly - you can tell that a lot of R & D went into these.The Talk Through mode is also good - although I think it makes the music so low that you really can't even hear it - but it is handy in case you need to have a conversation. I've had a conversation with Ambient Aware mode turned on, and I can hear the other person just fine.Okay, here is where I'll start making some assumptions. I don't have another pair of BT earbuds to compare to, so I'm assuming that other companies would create apps similar to the ones for their BT headphones when making apps for their ear buds.The JBL app is my favorite one. It's very easy to get into, has some settings you can change (like what each ear bud does when you touch it certain ways), as well as allows you to change the audio mode that you've enabled.Now, I have a pair of Anker BT headphones, and they are really comfy, but the app is nowhere near as feature-rich as the JBL app is.I guess if there is anything that I don't like about these it would be the inability to turn them off without using the app. You can set them to time out after a set amount of time, so they would turn themselves off at some point, but I think that is a waste of the battery, so I use the app to turn them off.Another thing I don't like is the case - the ear buds fit into it in a very awkward way - I'm always having to twist my wrists to get them in correctly. I think this was a major design flaw, but it's minor compared to all the other benefits of these.One thing I absolutely love on these is the battery. I've used these for about an hour, turned them off (via the app), kept them outside of the case, and come back to them a month later, and they are still at the same battery percentage as a month ago - unbelievable.I should also mention that the battery lasts a fair amount of time when actually listening to them. I use these when working out, and they last plenty of time for me to run and lift weights.I've never actually tried to figure out exactly how long they last on one charge, but if I'd have to guess, it's probably upwards of 5 hrs at least.To save battery power, I usually put mine in a ziplock bag, along with the case - so that the battery gets to run-down without being recharged all the time. I only put them back into the case when the battery is actually low.The case also charges very quickly (as do the ear buds as well).So, overall, I'd highly recommend these ear buds. They have some minor issues that I've discussed, but in my opinion, the pro's far outweigh the con's for these.If you found this review helpful, please click on ""helpful"" or the thumb's up.Thanks.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023",AEVRSFNYMIZ3OQFLXTDUEWLZW7YA,1,283,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones

R1410OSM6X1DP8,B09FM6PDHP,"3.0 out of 5 stars Not good for motorcycle use, but excellent sound quality.",Jeffrey Jenkins,3,"I bought these in an attempt to improve upon the mediocre sound quality of the ""MiPeace"" earbuds I've been using on my motorcycle for about a year now, and in that respect the JBL did not disappoint - these really are quite good sounding (almost as good as my old Etymotic ER-6 wired earbuds). Sitting on my bike with the engine running but not moving the active noise cancellation seemed to work very well - I couldn't hear the engine at all, actually - but once I started moving things weren't quite so rosy. It seems the active noise cancellation is just a tad too slow to respond to wind buffeting noise because the music is horribly distorted as if one is listening to speakers through the spinning blades of a fan. Unfortunately, with the active noise cancellation turned off the silicone cup style earplugs don't do near as good a job of passively blocking ambient sounds as the silicone triple-rib style earplugs on the MiPeace (or the Elgin's I replaced these with), so I reluctantly returned them.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AFULIFC3V2ECRHMU7GIFX6PYSOHQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones

The other downside is that the finger controls are finicky and always seem to activate when Im just re-positioning them in my ear; then they dont always work when I actually need to pause music or answer a call.But as basic headphones theyre great. Pluses: the sound is fantastic for the price, the charge lasts most of the day with continuous use, and they charge fast. Unlike the earlier models, they connect to my phone as soon as I open the case, so theyre ready to use by the time I put them on.

(So great for shopping during the holidays, you can block out all the crowd chatter and repetitively Christmas music!)- Ability to switch noise cancellation modes is easy! (So you can optionally listen to people speak while cutting out a few decibles like fan noise.)- Build quality is solid!- The JBL app works flawlessly!- They connect to phone and other devices easily, total plug & play!Cons:- They tend to disconnect more often, which isnt that annoying per se  except it makes a beep sound to alert you that something is wrong. (The Apple earbuds just turn off, so theres no jarring loud beep in your ears.) This is especially annoying when it happens in the middle of a song.- This one is weird  If you hold the two earbuds in your hand, and they touch in a certain way, it makes a loud chirping noise. (Almost like the feedback of two microphones being too close together.)- Theyre kind of bulky, and fall out of my ears more often than the Apple AirPods did. Even after changing the rubber tips. (The bright side is that because theyre so bulky, theyre easier to find on the ground.)- Though you can use the JBL app to find your earbuds, it doesnt help you find the charging chase.Conclusion:- For $50, Ill keep em! The sound quality is truly excellent enough to look past the weird quirks.And if they get lost, as most earbuds often do, it wont break my wallet to do so. (The Apple ones are comfy and have less quirks, but kind of overrated at that price point.)So I would buy JBL earbuds again  though I might look into the smaller models, that maybe (hopefully) arent as prone to pop out of the ear like a cartoon bean.","Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AFZYWTX4DWEYTGWMVJVRWCJBXPIA,1,50,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones

R1IG9HV4RNJRWA,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing,Ken,3,"There are several things I like about the JBL 230. The sound quality is pretty good and the noise cancelling is excellent for this price range. So, if you're in a noisy office or work environment, these may work for you. The battery life is great, and the JBL app provides a good equalizer for customizing your sound. I love the blue color, and the touch controls work, even if finding that ""sweet"" spot takes a bit of practice.What I don't like is that every time you put the earbuds in, they start in the ""Ambient Aware"" mode (sounds around you are amplified). It's great, if you want to hear what Margret down in accounting thinks about Bob's new haircut from across the room, but I hate it. I'm typically putting in earbuds to block out the sound around me, not to make it louder. Plus, the Ambient Aware function uses battery life. I'd much rather have the ability to start in a ""normal"" (non-amplified) setting, but that's not available. You have to start with them active and either open up the app to turn it off or set the buds to use a touch feature to turn it off (meaning you can't use the touch feature to control your music, change volume or anything else).My second gripe is around the microphones and wind. Any slight breeze makes it impossible for you to be heard at the other end of a phone call. I'm often outside and I simply can't make phone calls if there's a breeze. Likewise, driving with the windows down while on the phone is a no-go. The wind drowns out everything else. If you happen to have Ambient Aware turned on (remember, it's the default?), it amplifies that wind noise in your ears, as well, even if you're not on the phone. This is a real deal breaker, and everyone from Apple to Samsung and Sony do a much better job of limiting wind noise on phone calls with their buds.There are other minor things. The buds are very lightweight, which is good, but they stick a little too far out of my ear, so they're always getting knocked loose. They sit in the case with the speakers facing outward, so you always have to turn them around when taking them out or putting them away, since most people are designed with their ear canals going *in* to their heads (this design makes zero sense). The app is slow to load. You can't do anything in the app until it finds and connects to your buds, so you have to have at least one bud in to use the app for anything, which is weird (I can't even view the app right now to tell you about it because my buds are at home, so the app won't open), and many app features aren't accessible unless you have both buds in.I really wanted to like these, but the inability to use them in 90% of the cases I want them just makes them worthless to me.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AFKKJU65DENPLES5WGHT46LVPJJA,1,129,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones

This case is so slippery. I am someone very mindful of my electronics and have never so much as cracked a phone screen, but I can't even count how many times this case has just slipped out of my hands or off of a surface. The charging lights on the case have began to malfunction. I like these earbuds, but I would recommend storing the case in a pouch or something with a little more grip to it.As for the earbuds themselves, they're great. I've had them for a year now and they work wonderfully. The audio quality is great, not the best but worth the price. They fit into my ears wonderfully and don't slip out easily which is quite rare for me. The Bluetooth range also seems to be quite large and I never have issues with that.One other thing is that the battery has definitely dwindled rapidly in the past year, but I use these earbuds everyday for at least a few hours, so that's to be expected. I don't mind charging them more often. The earbuds themselves still last about five to seven hours on a full charge, which is absolutely perfect for me.I like these earbuds a lot.

R3CQL0C7IB5R18,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Ambient Aware white noise,Adam,3,"Edit: Dropping original 5/5 for both earbuds to 3.5/5. Connectivity problems occasionally. I had the microphone just straight up gave up in the middle of a call and had to restart my computer to get it back to work again, unpair and pair didn't work. Occasionally, they randomly disconnect for a second or so, like every couple of hours on average. When that happens, there's a chance for one ear bud to be slightly delayed than the other, and has to unpair and pair to fix.If you use both earbuds all the time, then it's great for $50-60. 5/5Comfortably fit in my ears and don't fall out much when jogging. They'll still fall out when the moving is too much, but that's unavoidable in any earbuds like this. ANC works wonders. The sound quality is good for the price. Microphone is hit and miss like every other earbud out there, but generally works well.If you ever use just the right earbud, then it's awful. 0/5The ambient aware gives out a very audible white noise all the time. And it will automatically be turned on if you only use the right earbud. You cannot turn it off because the ambient aware setting is on the left earbud only. You can only turn that off in the phone app. But if the earbud is not connected to the phone, then you can't change it.One work around is to go to the phone app and let both earbud to have the ambient aware on off functions, but you will lose the right earbud's play/pause function. And you need to turn it off every single time you use it.The connection chime and setting change chimes are extremely loud and I can't find a way to lower the volume. So that's further annoyance. This applies to both single and both earbuds modes.I personally hate these and will be returning the earbuds.

That would be a pair of L26 speakers, I purchased on lay-a-way, when I was 16, back in 1976 for $875. That would be over $6000 in 2023 dollars. Later I purchased JBL's J2050 Book-Shelf speakers and later still JBL's Media 100 Desk-Top speakers. I guess you would say, I would recommend JBL products, since I've had a 48 year relationship with their brand.I was on the brink of returning the JBL Tune 230NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Ear-Buds but decided to contact JBL Customer support, to find out why I was unable to connect my ear-buds to my TV. I submitted a fairly detailed explanation, sufficient for their support staff to realize I was already paired to my phone. So I learned that ear-buds come in single-pairing and multi-point-pairing. The JBL Tune 230NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Ear-Buds are single-pairing, which is just fine for me. These ear-buds can be very immersive, watching TV or Listening to music. The noise cancellation does a nice job of muffling surrounding noise. I had taken them with me on walks to listen to music or books-recordings and I became a bit concerned at how much of the sound around me was deadened. You then have to keep your head on a swivel.As these are my first ear-buds, I don't know if this is common but while out for a walk, the microphone ports, built into the ear-buds, pick up and transmit the sound of the wind scouring the microphone ports.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGJRRXVA43IHAW4WHREBWAXE2GYQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros  These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical clicky buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons  The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldnt recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didnt care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter b in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros  Very comfortable with the same great physically clicky buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons  Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros  A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons  Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didnt stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros  Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons  Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldnt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros  Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesnt open accidentally.Cons  This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a flayed shape rather than the rounded shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldnt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didnt realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2277,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.THE SOUNDBoth the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!CONNECTIVITYThese connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly dont need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.FITThe fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)THE CONTROLSThe controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON& which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.BATTERYThe battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?RANGEVery good, about 30+ feetCONS-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isnt as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to youUPDATEthey have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case& which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived& only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,562,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

Wasn't expecting it to be that different. But, alas, it is. Now with that said, these here are super affordable. If you're on a budget get them.

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged its like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if its not straight up refusing to connect its disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so thats a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didnt pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,65,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

I'm no audiophile but they sound great for the price I paid. They are comfortable and light. They look great but the case is big. The mic isn't too good but works when needed. The color is really what I got them for. She loves pink. She has really small ears and the headphone ear plugs that came with these were all too big. We swapped them out a few months later and haven't heard anything about it yet from her. So I'm assuming they are working great. She dropped one into the sink and they were soaked and stopped working for a few days I riced them and blowdried them and they came back to life. Still sound as good as ever.

R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means its a solid product but theres something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. Theyre small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I dont know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But thats just it, theyre alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So its understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.Im also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. Theres something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge thats just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesnt have that premium feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, its not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. Im sorry, but they do look a little&funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the b logo is upright. They dont stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, youll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but thats beyond pretty much anyones control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They dont do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldnt say these are the best Ive ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating&the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,1,1697,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and its there for both buds plus case.Theyre not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. Theyre more noise reducing, so if thats your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again its just enough to say its there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than whats pictured.Theyre extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it. I can honestly forget them in my pockets from how light they are.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AHPNYX3N7YSFKEGN2VREBPXEGT7A,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldnt even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, its quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions Im considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I cant fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the products popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. Ill continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

These headphones are, in fact, a cut above their competitors at cheaper levels. These things connect seamlessly with my Galaxy s23, and are pretty much rolling by the time you slide them in your ear.

R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AE4SCIH4EIJQNY4BA7TKFA7WD6IQ,1,1,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

Although it had a charging cable, the length is very short. The sound quality is okay. The box included additional tip sizes for your ears. They are comfortable. These Beats Studio Buds were available at another retailer, but not in this red color. I was excited to be able to purchase this red for the same price here at Amazon. Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller. The small size of the case allows it to fit inside my jacket pocket, purse pocket, and pencil pouch.

Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb.

There are better options for that, but mowing the lawn it did a great job of making sure I could only hear the voices in my head, post medication (just kidding). Highly recommended product and especially those that like red because it's a nice color and I'm happy I could finally get rid of these, not-so-manly, pink ones I keep borrowing from my wife.

Mr & Mrs,4,"Loved the ear buds. I use it mostly to listen to music and podcasts while I work on chores. Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on =.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,,,

The sound quality is very good. I have an iPhone which is supposed to be ideal to use with these Beats but I have ongoing connectivity issues. I have some really cheap ear buds that as soon as I pick up the ear bud, it connects to my phone. These take longer and sometimes simply dont connect at all. Then I have to put them back in their case and try again. Im not sure if it is because my iPhone is an older model, but that shouldnt matter as far as I know. For an Apple product, their quality falls short. I wouldnt recommend these. I have had better experiences with Taotronics brand. These Beats were on sale and I thought Id treat myself to something more upscale. I wont do that again.UPDATE: I recently got a newer iPhone and wanted to edit my original review.

The bose are heavier but are definitely secure. The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around. I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast. I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good. Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set. Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks.

RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,1,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,1,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R2J7QWXMNJ99A7,B096SV8SJG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Slippery design, battery and other issues!",Amazon Customer,3,"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGNI36H7MMREKIH6HPQHV2CGG7BA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to musicalso fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped outinto a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 1530 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with.

R2ZTC75NUZSKYY,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent for the price when on sale,Amazon Customer,4,"Well lets start off with I bought these on sale for around $80.If I wouldve paid the full amount of 150 Im not going to lie and say I wouldnt have been disappointed.Apple bought out beats audio a few years back so I expected more. The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they arent too compatible with Siri. Im a delivery driver so I cant always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they wont read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesnt always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. Thats the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall theyre decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they dont fit right.Another thing I might add is that theyre a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale theyre worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I wouldve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, its nice that the case charges them. Theres also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it. On the case itself it only has a small light that turns red when low.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023",AFFMX6QW56DDKHV6PJ4JGPCEPVNA,1,21,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesnt do any good when their charging box is hours away and youre out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that dont sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable.

R1JBQTP05FUBYC,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price,DocBrown,5,"Ive been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought Id try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The Quick setup guide was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone. Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. Im in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyones ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds. I cant comment on failed bub issues yet, its too early, so well see.I didnt intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFWLU4KB7AN2ZGSOS3HICOKC44SQ,1,26,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R1YXPTOD9CWT3I,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound at a good price,Ben W.,5,"I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didnt want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasnt really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. Ill get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I dont think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only issue I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. Its a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. Ive owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds Ive had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like its naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. Its really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and its nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2021",AE7GOV7WYUWHSSVCGB5SQSMJI34Q,1,76,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

Though if you're looking for something with strong noise cancellation, you might want to consider looking for a different pair of ear buds, as these are really only capable of blocking out most speech. Overall, they're a pretty good pair of ear buds, but I do have a few problems with them.First, when they get to low battery, the text to speech voice will say ""Recharge headset"" just frequently enough to become mildly vexing. This is my primary complaint about these ear buds.Now mind you, I haven't treated these ear buds very well, they went through constant abuse and were used in sub-optimal environments the entire time I've owned them. The next two complaints are likely a result of my poor treatment of these.Second, after about two years of use, their connectivity isn't as great anymore; the range in which I can use these has dropped considerably. I used to be able to walk in my backyard without issues, but now I can barely leave the room without the connection dropping constantly.Lastly, the left earbud has recently developed a problem with connecting to the case; it seems the leads just don't connect half the time. This occasionally causes small inconveniences with the left ear bud turning on in the case and randomly hijacking the audio output of my pc, or it just doesn't end up charging and I'm stuck with a single ear bud until I manage to get it to charge again.Overall, this is a pretty good product. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a pair of long-lasting wireless earbuds and doesn't need the best sound quality or noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2023",AFRT3UTZANKCA7EGGKYQAVIXOJ5Q,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
RB0NQXL4O1IZ,B08ZR5JB9G,1.0 out of 5 stars Only really lasted 8 months,Jake Boop,1,"Edit: originally rated 1 star as the earbuds that I received were open-box/used. I dont think its fair to Sennheiser that my 1 star rating remains on here because that was a fault of Amazon. These earbuds sound great. Absolutely great. The connection seems to be good so far as well (Ive seen a lot of negative reviews saying otherwise). They are very comfortable for my ears, Im a Tool Maker/machinist and wear an earbud in one ear I all day and other earbuds that Ive tried get uncomfortable or start to fall out but I have had no issues with fit at all. As far as the features on the app: the equalization is only a 3-band eq which is a shame, Id much rather at least a 5 or 7-band eq but its better than nothing for sure. The side tone feature is supposed to use the mic to feed into the speaker, allowing you to hear outside talking, but it doesnt seem to really work at all. I havent tested a phone call using them yet so maybe my mic is defective but I really wouldnt care because I dont need it. Overall this is a great pair of earbuds for the price.Original review: This item came in with the packaging already opened with another piece of tape over the original seal. The earbuds were covered in earwax and ear hair. Disgusting. If I wanted to buy an open box/used I wouldve selected that option instead of paying full price for it.Edit 3/14/2023: it's been 8 months and the connectivity issues have been becoming a decent problem. I take them out of the case and they won't connect, so I put them back it and take them out again and usually they'll connect after the second try. But lately I've been having to re-pair them to my phone. I'll take them out of the case and instead of the usual ""power on..... connected"" notification, it's just silence. And it's not as simple as just re-pairing them because they won't go into pairing mode unless I reset them. The battery life is also taking a dive.I started out really loving these, now I've been very disappointed because they're just such a hassle to deal with. With all of this, especially only being 8 months of use, I'm going to have to update my review from 5 stars to 2.Edit 7/17/2023: the right earbud just stopped working all together, it'll power on but refuses to connect to BluetoothEdit 1/24/2024: I've been trying to get as much use out of these just to justify the amount I spent on them before I replace them but all it has really given me is issues with connectivity and reliability. I expect any earbuds at this price range to last years, I should have no problem getting the same life out of earbuds that you would expect from a phone. I wish I would've just either returned them or thrown them away a long time ago. I'm going to start looking into replacements now. Adjusting my 2 star rating to a 1 star.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AE2R5XX5O7LVG57B7S2L22VH2QIA,1,10,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R32H19VXW9WGNF,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison with Momentum TW,Steve Kranyec,5,"I have a pair of CX's that are about 1.5 years old, and another set that I just recently purchased. In the middle, I have a pair of Momentum TW 3's that are ~6 months old. The TLDR here is that instead of repurchasing the Momentum, I got another pair of the CX's.I'm not an audiophile, and I mostly listen to audiobooks and make calls with earbuds, so I'm not going to be speaking to audio quality at all. For me, it's fine.My six month old Momentum's have a dead left earbud. Possibly this is anecdotal, but if anything I was more gentle with the Momentum's than the CX's, and the CX's have lasted three times as long. Yes, I drop them. Yes, the dead left Momentum died after the most recent drop. I'm not saying that earbuds should survive infinite drops, but in my experience, the CX's are more durable.I did really really like the ANC on the Momentum's. It killed the battery life, but when you need ANC, it was great to have. The pass-through audio was also awesome. It was almost like having a mini-hearing-aide.The CX's have been substantially less finicky than the Momentum. They connect quicker, I've had to reset them fewer times, and they seem to have better range.Between the (substantial) difference in price and the areas where the CX's are superior, I my opinion, the CX's are the better option. If dropping $150 every six months on earbuds is within your budget, I fully endorse the Momentums. For me, I need to have two working sets around at any given time as I wear them a substantial amount of my waking hours, so I'd rather swap to an overear model when I need ANC and go with the cheaper and more durable option.Quick recommendation -- splurge on the foam eartips. If you're like me and wear earbuds an unhealthy amount of time, they're substantially more comfortable. They do wear out, and they're not cheap, but the added comfort for long-wears is huge.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AGW3GZDQI7IIZB7FOD2IAOKUKMGA,1,8,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R2M4WDO3B23EX,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, Horrible mic for calls",billyillyilly,3,"The good, these ear buds have a decent battery life, sit well in the ear without falling out (held with just the rubber insert), have good (not great) sound quality. A perfect example of the sound is with FFDP ""A little bit off"" which has extremely clean sound on a quality system. These ear buds lack the clean treble when the high hat hits and the deep tones of the bass. If you just want sound without worrying being an audiophile they're good.The bad, no noise cancelling... at all! During phone calls the mic is good in a quiet place. if there is ANY background noise, they will pick up that noise over your voice. I tried them multiple times in different cars and no matter the amount of road noise it drowned out my voice making conversations almost impossible unless I yelled. In an office environment the sound of the keyboard while typing would make conversation hard to understand for whoever was sorry enough to be on the other end of the call.I've been a Sennheiser fan for a long time and have had many of their headphones (still use some old wired buds CX100II for listening to music at work and love them), these are the first that I am returning due to be unusable for conversation.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2024",AHYASE5EWU5VJUIBY7QPUY6JS6FA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R1DTEWZS5AYFKH,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Not quite what I expected,Michal D. Wisteria,2,"So I'll start with the positive. The headphones are comfortable, the sound is great, and the battery life is pretty good too (supposed to be 9.5 hours, I got around 7). The bass felt great, skipping songs was a breeze, and the sound quality when answering calls on them was decent as well.The less great parts. After 6 1/2 hours or so, one headphone would die, usually the left one. Then the right would reconnect, and I could keep listening to things for a bit longer. But the biggest reason for the 2 star review is that my right earbud broke after about 11 months. I took good care of these headphones; they were usually in their case or in my ear. Last week I noticed the right earbud had no sound. I thought I just had to restart them and reconnect, but after a few tries of that I heard just hints of sound for half a second when moving the earbud in the ear, so I knew the audio wasn't working. But all the other features were. I could still pause, skip songs, etc with the right or left earbud. I went on my order page on Amazon and found the support section. There was a link to a product support site for Sannheiser... It was 404, page not found. There was a phone number too.... It was disconnected apparently. So now I have just a left side, good-sounding earbud.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2022",AEKYYYRFAHIBUCQXZMRBNGIQET3A,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

R30839P76Q86K9,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, good physical construction outside. Elsewhere, not so much",Ben,3,"I've owned a few pairs of earbuds, all wired. I prefer over-ear headphones, but needed something small, portable and more discreet for work.These looked decent and my past experiences with Sennheiser sound quality also helped make my decision at the time.Sound quality is excellent, overall noise isolation is pretty good for no ANC, bass mids and highs are all present and clear. I do own several pairs of studio/reference headphones, which these obviously don't compare to, but they do manage to make a good account of themselves. Battery lifespan is excellent too and despite no wireless charging (not that it was a deal breaker in my case) the case charged very quickly. Just would have been nice if the charging cable was longer than the dinky one supplied.I used the smallest set of ear cushions, these are decently comfortable for up to a couple hours but do start to press against my ears for longer periods.Construction quality of the case and buds is decent, not too heavy but not feather light either. It's a shame that doesn't go into the internal electronics.First off, the Bluetooth connectivity is not a win. These would repeatedly disconnect themselves when bringing them out of ""sleep"" always one or the other bud. The Sennheiser Smart Control App does allow customization of the buds controls and a graphic equalizer. But it would keep proclaiming it needed a update, even though it was the most up-to-date version.Now these, when they paired, sounded great. After using these for nearly a year, the right bud suddenly had an internal fault and produced flakey, weak sound. That was not a Bluetooth issue, but rather the hardware either failing on a circuit level or a wire becoming loose due to a cold solder joint. I've owned plenty of headphones that are more cheaply made than these with worse sound quality but still function as intended.Looking up this problem seems to be inherit with the CX True Wireless, with complaints occuring anywhere from a few months of ownership to nearly a year or more. Replacements from Sennheiser have been described as having a repeat issue after a similar period of time, or are merely DOA.Shame, this isn't the Sennheiser I knew. Time for a different pair from a different manufacturer. Why bother going through the hassle of dealing with Sennheiser support only to get the same problem again eventually?","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2023",AEMJ3ANYCQ7TYZVKGNNX23MRZP6A,1,13,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R3RE1QI7DDJ44X,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Good BT earbuds,Photographer,4,"I generally prefer over the ear headphones, but I use earbuds only when I am exercising or doing yardwork. I bought a pair of name brand earbuds that was on sale during BF. Long story short, I had to return it because the sound quality was unacceptable.Rather than trying to find a diamond in haystack so to speak, I picked Sennheiser as it is a brand that I have good experience with. Furthermore, I opted for a higher price point than the rock bottom price I was hoping for.I forgo noise cancelling since I don't need it most of the time. Sonically, this pair of earbuds is very good, bearing typical Sennheiser sound of open and balance. It is still no match for my over the ear headphones, but it is also significantly cheaper. Sound quality is by far the most important aspect, other features are distant seconds and thirds.BT connectivity is, however, not Sennheiser's strength. It took some work to get it connected to all of my devices; I have a pair of Sennheiser over the ear BT headphone that behaves similarly. All of my cheaper BT earbuds have no BT connectivity issues. This weakness is not a showstopper.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AES7SSQNH3WNT4EAPENHZ67TRHBQ,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

Sure they had the metal case and metallic earbuds and all those sizes earbud tips but internal quality was bad a constant buzzing sound from a bad chip so I ordered a second pair still bad so returned both of them. I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser of course.

Im an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.Now yes these are 100% plastic but they dont feel cheap and that plastic also means they dont feel cold touching your skinYes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause Ive had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.No wireless charging but who cares its USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work dayAnd the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but thats inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.Could you get better sound sure but why its Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better soundIf you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then youll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones youll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2021",AFV7ZI225WCIGLKBRRZGPKITFUKQ,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R167YMGKLUDYU2,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Comprehensive rating: Sennheiser puts sound first (as usual),Scott Herron,4,"After years of using cheap-o headphones and dealing with cable noise, listening to music with the headphones feels like i'm hearing each song for the very first time. I'm hearing details in songs I never heard before, it honestly made me tear up. Incredibly clarity, customizable EQ, AMAZING sound for 100$. You could easily get something with comparable sound that costs twice as much. The sound is why I bought these. Sennheiser is a sound-focused brand. However, there are some places where these headphones cut corners that would not be a problem if you bought 200$+ dollar headphones.Security: I'm a dancer, and I want my headphones to stay on while I'm working in the studio. However, the earbuds aren't the most secure in my ears. They fly out during chainée turns, sometimes even just as I'm walking they'll fall out.Comfort: Not the most comfortable for hours of listening. After 2-3 hours of extended use, my ears ached. Changing up the plastic tips didn't help.Noise cancelling: I heard the ANC takes the edge off the sound quality, which is why I bought these and not the active noise cancelling ones. You can definitely tell. I can hear each step I take as I walk thudding in my ears. It's a little odd.Delay: I've tried to use these to watch tiktoks on my phone, and I've noticed a delay in the screen and the sound. I can see the person on my screen moving their mouth, but the words come out into my headphones a little later. It's not the worst, but it's noticeable.Overall: Great for audiophiles on a budget. The app allows you to customize, so there's something to love for everyone, whether you love a sparkling, bright treble or you're a total basshead. For sitting down and listening while you're at your computer, these are an excellent choice. If you're mainly wearing these for working out, maybe something else would suit your needs better. I do equal parts both, which is why I like these a lot. mp3 files can massacre the music quality, and bad headphones can make the sound even muddier. These are an excellent buy.

And I love that there is an equalizer in the app so you can adjust it to sound the way you want it. They offer a lot of cool features that apparently not all earbuds have. You can change what the different taps do, but they are capable of answering your phone, raising and lowering the volume, fast forwarding, rewinding, or skipping tracks of songs, pausing and playing - all just buy tapping on the earbuds. Even though it is not one of their advertised features, they also do a very good job of noise canceling as long as they fit in your ear properly.So here's the downside that I found... These earbuds are large and square. Most ears are pretty round. I realize that all ears are shaped differently, but I have a hard time believing that these fit comfortably in most ears. If you're just sitting still at your desk or in the car, it's not too bad. But if you smile really big, they come loose, and If you lean over, they fall out of your ear entirely. When the Stem is seated properly in your ear, The big square part rubs uncomfortably against the outer ear. For this reason alone I am debating whether to return these, or Just suffer with it since I mostly use them in the car or at work. These could be great earbuds if they were more organomically designed.One last note - I don't have a lot to compare it to. But they advertise that the battery life is superior on these, and i'm not convinced. Now I admit I had them running for most of an 8 hour workday. But I had to switch between the left ear and the right ear while one of them was charging in the case, i'd use the other one.

Theyre not super bassy like the Beats and Raycons Ive had, which in some ways are better. I think a lot of peoples problems with these is that they arent proper Audiophile material like some of Sennheisers other products, but if youre looking for wireless buds, you probably arent really looking for the greatest sound on the market.I like the software that these use.

It also lets you switch between sources more easily than some other Bluetooth headphones.I will say that these arent the most ergonomic earbuds ever, they fit just fine normally, but if you try to sleep with them, or put any pressure on your ear with a hat or something, they really dig into your ears, but thats a non issue to most people.The noise cancellation is decent, but Im pretty sure theres not any tech behind it like with the AirPods, I think these just plug up your ears so you dont hear the outside noise, and they do that pretty well.The case is pretty good too.

I bought this one on Black Friday and have been using it for several days. I now have three pairs of earbuds: Apple AirPods, SkullCandy and this one, which took me the most time to pair and connect.1) The small paper guide conveniently didn't mention that a small film on the mental contact must be peeled off. The charging case showed green light after a couple hours charging but I couldn't get them to connect. It was only after researching the questions section that I learned about this step (so apparently others were confused too).2) The shape of the earbuds make it difficult to grab and pull them out of the charging case. Each time it takes more than one try.3) No indicator light on the front of earbuds themselves to show the battery level. My SkullCandy (much cheaper but equally good sound quality) has indicator light on the earbuds. It would become red to tell me to put it back in the charging case.4) To connect to a device for the first time is confusing. A YouTube clip tells me to watch the little light in the back to blink red/blue to indicate it's ready to pair/connect. But when I tried to connect with a second device (after disconnecting from the first one), it didn't blink. The guide shows to put fingers on the earbuds (after inserting into the ears) to put it in paring mode. The SkullCandy doesn't require any additional step: after the earbuds are taken out of the case, a voice tells you that it's ready to connect.5) It won't let you switch from one device to another easily. When I turn off the Bluetooth on my iPad and tried to switch to my cellphone (with earbuds still in my ears), I can't connect right away. I wound up having to put them back in the case and then take them out to connect to the second device (unlike SkullCandy, which stays in pairing mode and lets you connect to the 2nd device right away).All in all, It's not worth the value compared to a cheaper but better product like SkullCandy.Added 12/27/2022: Now that Ive used for more than three weeks (bought on Black Friday), I should downgrade the rating from my initial 3 stars to 2 stars. I finally managed to connect it with my laptop after several attempts but it seemed random and I still dont know how it happened. And it happened several times that one of the earbuds would lose sound for no apparent reason while I was using them.

However I had bought so many, I was tired of it and gave these the benefit of the doubt.Here I am a month and a half later and the issue alas only gotten worse. I don't know if it's Senheiserners fault, or the particular pair I got, but either way I couldn't put up with it any longer, thankfully Amazon offered me a full refund, and I intend on buying the ""Google Pixel Buds A-Series"" (the ones I was originally going to get)I really wanted these earbuds to work, and I took perfect care of them. I didn't let them over charge, I never dropped them or tossed them once. So I know for a fact that fault wasn't mine own atleast.If you want good earbuds of a similar price, I dunno, this is the most expensive pair I've owned.If you want good earbuds of a cheaper price try the Mpow M30 Plus, I've had that pair for almost two years and they have failed me only twice in all that time (and it was my fault). Or maybe I genuinely just got a bad pair, I don't know. I know when these earbuds worked, they were excellent.I have had great experiences with Senheiser in the past, this is the first time they've let me down.Hopefully this is the last negative Earbud review I ever have to make, we'll see Goggle Pixel Buds A-Series, I'm coming for you next, don't fail me too.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2022",AFHOTNY7QTDBDCLJRYRG2OVX3S4Q,1,2,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

Big fan of the design as well both in regards to the earbuds and the case. As great as they sound I ended up going with a different pair for one reason, comfort. These feel terrible. Theyre on the heavy side due to the thick build( which allows for bigger batteries) and keeping them in your ears is a chore. Once I did get them to stay, I found myself taking them out after 20 minutes because my ears were sore.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2024",AE3DDUSAT567JAEGHBPVSMIWAAHA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

It is priced pretty competitively, and gives great bang for the buck. The battery life is good, sound quality is great, and passive noise cancellation is also fairly decent, but might have to turn the volume up if in a crowder place. The only gripes I have with it are that the bluetooth drivers are not great, and I have faced several connectivity issues. They are also quite a bulky pair, and fit a bit awkwardly in the ear because of their shape and size, so you do start feeling the fatigue after a couple of hours in listening sessions.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023",AHS2Q6FGZSSQWZPKGWR5E7UGEERQ,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

I assume the mic is good on these considering the other end never asks twice or asked me to repeat what I've said. I usually have on a single bud while using and that works fine for both listening to music and calling. The battery life is fantastic. I get better mileage out of it compared to the Galaxy buds. Personally I think these are more comfortable than the Galaxy buds and the sound quality is superior to the Galaxy buds. That might not be the case for everyone. The Sennheiser CX is a bit bulky, so angling and fit I could see not working out for everyone. They are snug for me and generally a great fit, however I have had an instance of it falling off once or twice. The best part is price in my opinion, beats the Galaxy buds in sound quality and is cheaper. Personally I like it's design, but it being a bit bulky they aren't the most discreet.

R2FY7S14FVDT3C,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Useful for listening to music at work,Jeremy Davis,4,"Ive used these earbuds for about a week now. Sound quality is very good, however the bass is a bit lacking, which I was expecting when I purchased these.The noise cancellation is passive, which was something I was actively looking for in earbuds. I work in an environment where I communicate frequently with coworkers, so I didnt want too much bass or any active noise cancellation.The battery life and charging time has been stellar. I can wear these from 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM without much concern for the battery life. I usually charge them while I eat lunch, which essentially ensures they will last me the whole day.These headphones do utilize an application to update firmware. The app is pretty standard. Its easy to use, and it lets you customize the sound balance. It is a bit annoying that you have install an app and a firmware update for these.Touch controls are relatively standard as well. The app does let you customize these controls, but since I have a smart watch, the only touch function I use is the play/pause single tap.Overall, I am very happy with the product.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2022",AHKLDEPJRNY6SHU4E6VC2TTCJWKA,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R36KYYVGPMLU43,B08ZR5JB9G,3.0 out of 5 stars Not what I'd expect from Sennheiser...,Cody Groat,3,"I bought these after I lost my JBL Live 300's. Was looking for something equally as good but for a bit cheaper. Stumbled across these and looked at some reviews. Flossy Carter's review is what gave me the go ahead, but boy was he wrong on this one.These are extremely cheaply made (case and earbuds feel horrible to the touch), the earbuds are uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes, the sounds quality is nothing as you'd expect from Sennheiser. And the horrid app is nearly unusable.Normally I'd excuse the sound quality when you can set your own equalizer, but the app to do that doesn't work half the time. When you launch it, it just flat out doesn't connect to the earbuds. It will show them for a second but then say connection failed. If you get pass this, the app is extremely slow and buggy. Even if the app worked, the equalizer only includes bass, mids, and highs so you can't fully customize it to your liking.For some good points about these earbuds. They are lightweight and don't move around easily in your ear. The magnets to secure the earbuds and close the case feel great. The touch controls are very responsive. The sound queues and tones are clear and easy to understand. And the battery life is good + it charges quickly.So give these earbuds a pass and go with the JBL Live 300's. Much better sound quality, and an app that works. They are $150 retail but frequently go on sale for $100 (I got them for $75 on amazon). You'll also be getting auto play/pause, and a slightly better water resistance rating at IPX5.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2021",AFL7DAIS7RHT23VDIZF4BZKBABWQ,1,44,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R3I5RQ4VA1B53P,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Bang For Your Buck,Josh B,5,"I like a good sounding headphones/earbuds. I think most of us do, at least anyone looking into something like Sennheiser.That being said, I usually go to Bose, because they have fantastic sound, and, they are the most comfortable for me. The wingtips really help keep them in my ears, and since they're soft silicone, it's comfortable.I typically don't like in ears with this design. They annoy my ears to the point that I just can't wear them for more than an hour. These on the other hand are actually quite comfortable. They aren't the most comfortable thing on the planet, but I find myself able to wear them for hours at a time without feeling any fatigue.The noise canceling does leave a little to be desired, but it's definitely present. It doesn't suck the world out like a nice pair of over ears or a really, really nice sent of ANC in ears. But, for the price point, they weren't so far away from things double, or even almost triple the price. They're great.The best thing about these earbuds, though, is their sound quality. They sound absolutely fantastic. Now, if you're a basshead, they probably aren't quite for you. But if you want to hear the nice boomy bass, punchy kids, and sparkly highs; these are fantastic. You can hear the low end a bit better with the bass boost profile, you can even EQ them in app to your preferences. But for me, the take home with these was the solid sound signature. I could hear all of the lower undertones of sound work in the high end, while getting a nice clear sounding low end. Again, if you're really looking for that low end - low kids punch, these probably won't do it for you. But if you want all aspects of your song to stand out equally, these are great.At this price, if you're thinking about getting them. I say go for it. An absolute 10/10, again, especially at the price.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2021",AG2YD2ZLE53SHBGAQFBOQEUQUQEA,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

I tested it with different types of music (rock, hip-hop, spanish, etc), as well as some podcasts. While the sound quality across the board is good, it didn't outperform a $50 pair of Enacfire E90 earbuds I had before they stopped working. When it comes to bass, the old E90's actually did BETTER than these. The comfort is decent, and aren't heavy enough to fall off your ears. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the battery life since these STOPPED working less than 24 hours after they were delivered!Oh and about the failure, I mainly blame their (stupid) ""Smart Control"" app for this. Like I said before, the earbuds worked fine and paired quicky...until I used this dumpster fire of an app. At first, I was able to link the earbuds with the app and then I tried to update the firmware since it was available. Big, BIG MISTAKE. Even though the earbuds were (supposedly) at 90% battery and were recently charged with a fully charged case, I was instructed to put them them back into the case in order to start the update. After doing so and waiting an hour, the earbuds have refused to go into Bluetooth pairing mode.***UPDATE 08/22/2021***After contacting Sennheiser support via email, they suggested that I get a replacement pair, which is what I did. After getting them, I have to say, I now LOVE these earbuds! I don't know why, but this pair sounds a LOT better than the first ones I got. I can now safely say thay sound better than anything else I've tried, including my old E90's. Pairing was simple and fast, using a single earbud was effortless, and the range is fantastic.While I didn't get the 9 hrs of battery life that was advertised, the most I've gotten so far is about 7.5 hrs, which is still great for true wireless earbuds. Regardless of what you listen to, these earbuds sound amazing and have a great amount of bass. While a few have said that these are too heavy for their ears, it wasn't the case for me. I work in a warehouse where I'm constantly on the move, and I NEVER experienced a moment where I felt like these were going to fall off. That being said, I stand by my previous comment where I say that these won't fall off your ears, even if you're moving around. These are rated as IPX4 water resistant, which I'm going to say is legit since the warehouse does get hot and as a result, I do get pretty sweaty.***UPDATE #2, 09/10/2021***I once again find myself HATING these earbuds! After working perfectly for a few weeks, the left earbud of the REPLACEMENT (2nd) pair I got stopped working. Just like the 1st pair, I tried multiple resets, both soft and factory, and I get no audio from left side whatsoever. I also checked my devices' settings and can confirm that they work perfectly and are not the issue. At this point, I probably won't bother contacting support again and will just get rid of them. $130 in the trash thanks to Sennheiser!","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2021",AGCJFB7PLYJWNNGPHSOJ4A2LKAEA,1,57,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

So I decided to try these Sennheisers out as a replacement, and I'm really glad I did. The clarity and overall sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the Airpods. And the battery life is far superior as well. I take long walks every day with these, and only need to charge them maybe once every other week? Phenomenal.My only two gripes would be 1. the size of the case, which is somewhat bulky when shoved into a jeans pocket, and 2. the rubber tips that are included. Although they do provide 3 sizes (small, medium, large), I found all sizes of the Sennheiser tips to be too shallow for my ear canal, causing the buds to fall out rather easily.

I wanted something affordable but didn't want to sacrifice the sound quality that I was enjoying before, with a much better battery quality. These really haven't disappointed. They're not quite as good sound as the MOMENTUMS, but they are still very good for $70. I reckon most other brands you'd have to be spending at least $150 for this quality of sound. The battery life is incredible on them and they're my daily use when I'm commuting. The touch controls are great, much more intuitive than the MOMENTUMs. Their size is a massive improvement over the first MOMENTUMS, they do not stress my ears nearly as bad. Couldn't have been happier with this purchase. Sennheiser is the only audio company I purchase from, and they have rarely missed for me.

The (8 HOUR MAX) battery life is valid for only one of the earbuds, the other dies in half the time causing the other to also start spewing its ""Battery Low"" message until you set it back to charge. They say 27 hour only because you get about 3 Charges from the case, which is also Sad. The material they're made of (including the case) provides ZERO grip so you'll most likely have them simply slipping out of your grasp AND your ears. They refuse to stay in even during something as simple as a light walk, you'll find yourself constantly having to push them back in place. As for the connection, it's Horrid. As many other reviews state, sometimes one bud doesn't connect and you have to factory reset them about three times in a row to fix the issue. The Range is hot garbage. Doesn't even extend down a 12 ft. hallway. My 7+ year old Skullcandy Hesh headphones have a longer range. A joke to be sure.

I'm no audiophile, but I've owned a pair of Phillips Fidelio X2HR for a while now and the Sennheiser CX sound just as good if not better. Except the CX are tiny wireless earbuds! It's unbelievable.I listen to all kinds of music and was blown away by the amount of detail that comes through when listening to classical music, you can hear different instruments come from different directions. It's really cool.I think the sound is perfectly balanced right out of the box, but you can customize it within the app. Bass heads will probably enjoy the bass boost function but personally I think the bass sounds fantastic in the neutral setting even with hip hop and EDM.I don't really plan on using the earbuds for anything else other than listening to music, so I can't comment on call quality but for $80 I am positive that this is the best option for that price.If I had to mention any negatives it's just that I wish these were just a little louder, but other than that these earbuds are incredible.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2021",AHRJ6KG74O2YZJ6UGNWKKAYM6NKQ,1,8,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

I knew I wanted Sennheiser, though, being that they are up there as a pinnacle of sound quality. I am not disappointed that I went with these. For the price of these, the sound quality is ""bussin',"" as the kids say. I honestly don't even know what to expect from a higher dollar bluetooth headphone. I really enjoy the equalizer that's on the Sennheiser app. It has many presets and also allows you to create your own preset based on what sounds better in certain situations and certain genres of music you are listening to at that time. My only complaint is the noise cancellation. Actually it's not even a complaint because these headphones don't claim to have noise cancellation. But if that is what you are looking for, you may want to look at some other options.

I primarily wanted ear buds to listen to podcasts and music while cleaning. These look really nice (better than apple ones, to me) and have some good features. I like the charging case and it seemed to keep a charge for a long time. I only tested them for a week or so, but I didn't need to charge the case much in that time period. The bad- the worst thing to me was that they kept falling out of my ears and even the smallest cover for the ear bud part wouldn't fit in my ear. That might be just my ears but it actually would start hurting if they were in for longer than 20 min or so. And they fell quite often. I also found when trying to use them for a call, the person on the other end couldn't hear me.

I use them every day and too many times have one earbuds connection been much weaker and the volume is drastically lower than the other (happens with both ear buds) and turning them off and on again and returning them to the case isn't enough and I'll have to repair my earbuds. I've had to do this every few weeks, sometimes even a few times in a week and pairing them has proven to be much more difficult than it should be. Often it said the earbuds couldn't be paired even though they were turned on and full battery. Another thing, my left earbud will die almost an hour before my right one does, and I make sure to clean them well so they charge.My left earbud also has the most connection issues as recently I'll hardly tap it or move my head and the earbud will lose connectivity and buffer a lot. I never listen to my earbuds with more than half volume as I don't need it because the sound quality is pretty good, but that means I know my speaker isn't blowing out and there's just issues with the manufacturing of this product.

Like all manufacturers, they will change the name of this model if they have not already done so to deflect their products from bad reviews so I can't trust anything they make.I've used these for over a month now and they keep disconnecting. I use them for several hours every day and this happens three or four times each week. If there is no audio for a few minutes, they disconnect but they will re-connect with a single click which is a minor inconvenience. However, they also just stop working randomly and will not re-connect at all. That could be a problem connecting with Bluetooth, but often one earbud will continue working when the other earbud is dead and must be re-charged. That proves that it is not a Bluetooth problem but a problem with the earbuds. Even after recharging, the dead earbud will not always re-connect easily. Frequently I need to remove them from my Bluetooth list then re-pair them which is a major inconvenience. I used to have a pair of wireless Sennheiser headphones that also would not stay connected. It seems Sennheiser doesn't know how to make something that will connect to Apple devices, which is too bad because they sound great and I like the controls.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2023",AG26TQWV757VVM7CQB7OTPND3ESA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

First impression out of the box: Well-made and beautifully packaged. It took me far too long to figure out why they weren't charging; turns out there was plastic film over the terminals, which I don't believe the documentation mentioned. (The documentation is pretty lame, btw...) Once over that hump, as soon as I got them connected to Bluetooth and to the app, it asked for a firmware update; this took an incredibly long time. First impression of the sound: crisp, clear, not quite loud enough (for me), but the low end is sorely lacking. Treble perhaps too bright. The EQ inside the app is pretty clever and helped improve the sound, but I was still hoping for more...ooomph...presence...<insert other audiophile words>. (For reference, I was listening to Spotify Premium (highest quality) over Bluetooth.) Phone call performance is excellent. Fairly comfortable/good fit.

Very annoying while at work or at home, and the firmware update did not fix this.Volume being weak, with no ANC, means you'll hear things around you if they're notably loud, unlike their other wired or wireless options. The quality of sound is not in necessary question, though music is definitely more subdued than other products from this company. There's less pop and energy.Battery life is good, at least.","Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2022",AF7XB2XL2KOLDZATOPUPDATJWBMQ,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

Who thought a a sensitive touch plane spanning the entire exterior of the earbud was a good idea?

One of the ear phones stopped producing any sound, so I sent them back for warranty service. The returned ear phones worked fine for a month, until one of them stopped working. I sent them back again for warranty service. The pair I have now are mostly OK, but occasionally, like today, one stops producing sound. I sort of ""reset"" them by placing them back in the case for a minute. So far that has worked - they both start working again. I have no idea if I've been getting replacement pairs, or if the original items were serviced. If they keep sending back the same pair then I'm just unlucky to have bought a lemon. If they are replacing the ear phones each time then there is a serious overall quality issue.I have one month left on my warranty and I worry they will fail for good after that date passes.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AHWIAWC4IF2O4X34PPGXSEHJHUFA,1,2,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

It's the high base sound right around the early voice range.Not always, but often enough.Look, I paid $25 for these cheap Sonys and they just sound better than these $80 Seinheissers.I'm on an S22 with the AptX codec running.My S7 with those cheap Sony wired earbuds produced better sound.Update: The sound is still the same, but I upped it a star, because these things are so convenient.I can leave my phone upstairs and walk around the whole house without losing signal.The battery life is very good too. Six hours? Then you can put the things in the charging case that has a battery in it to charge on the go.Each earbud operates solo if you need it.Comfort is so so. Took me awhile to get used to it.

I love green so a matcha color was perfect but there are very bug issues with it. 1st big issue is the charging, the buds dont always snap in to the case and connect with the magnetic prongs that charge them leading to me having to push them down (not hard but still) in order to make their they charge and often check on them. This also doesn't help thay their aren't really any indication lights other than 1 one the Case so unless you plug it up you really ain't got a way of knowing if the case is charged or not. Issue 2 the pairing & connecting, the right bud when pulled out with reconnect most of the time but sometimes needs me to manually select them in the Bluetooth menu while the left bud needs to be manually paired each and every time I use it just about, it's as if the bud is able to have a reconnecting memory unlike other skull candy products. 3 issue, this one is very minor but the hinge on the case is just to low you need to hold the cas a very special way or on a table to open or your finger will hold the cases lid shut which is just bad design and I honestly don't know how that made it pass concepts. 4th issue another small one but the Cases lid just opens way to easily when dropped as there's no magnet or just clip helping hold it shut like other brands or even skullcandys just literally sitting ontop of the cases lower part. For 24.99 I expected a product I wouldn't have to fight to use, and for a skullcandy product I expected quality but yet clearly there isn't a lot here in the products functionality.

R2HZ1PX4BEMFYR,B0C2F5KD26,"4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, love the color, long lasting charge",MJ,4,"I have been a Skullcandy fan for years. My previous buds the Indy Evo lasted almost 3.5 years. Excellent for midrange $. Hence I immediately returned to the brand for my next bud. I decided to try a different bud now we are in 2024 and the technology has evolved a bit more. Budget matters now more then ever in this economy. After looking at multiple reviews and several different new options they have out, I really was liking these for the look, fit and $. After having them home now and using them for about a week, here is my humble opinion. Pros: LONG battery life. I mean I think I charged it once overnight after it came home and put it on the charger again to check the status and it was still green. It is pleasing in appearance and definitely travels well in a pocket or purse. It has that little charge cord you see in my pictures. The c end goes to the case and usb to your computer, laptop or usb cube. I like the light indicator which tells you how charged the case is. The box comes with three different sized tips to ensure a good fit. The actual bud sits pretty comfortably because of the design. I have small ears and they dont hurt after 4+hrs of wear. Decent connectivity. I can leave my phone on the table and walk into an ajoining room. It depends on if there is to much between the phone and signal. If I go out to the yard to lock up the chickens and leave my phone in the house, thats about 30, I loose connection, but it automatically re-connects when in range. Cons: volume on these puppies with one bud and max volume on my phone is low, I mean like I am struggling to hear. I do have some very mild hearing loss, but I mean I am talking volume on max and it sounds like its on low. I didnt have this issue with the Indy Evo. The next and bigger issue is loose fit. Although ergonomically shaped for the ear, they are not secure for me. If I am just sitting working on something and listing or walking around listening not to bad, but as I continue to move my head around you can feel them coming loose. Over time they feel insecure. I constantly fiddle with them to re-secure them in place. I used to take daily walks at lunch with my Indy Evo, not sure I would feel safe doing that with these. I wouldnt want to lose a bud or drop it in the dirt. I might try sizing down to the small tips even though medium feels comfortable, just to see if this somehow gives a better secure fit? I miss the little fins on Indy Evo. They pretty much guaranteed those little suckers went nowhere. Overall I think I got what I paid for. In this day and age of technology and insane $$ this is a decent tech, good looking, excellent charge, easy carry and easy on the wallet. If I want something for they gym or what have you I would probably invest a little more money so I get something I dont have to worry about possibly losing.

Sound quality was excellent with a nice bass. The fit always seemed to need adjusting.A few years ago I tried the sport bluetooth version of Smokin Buds that go around the neck. these had same qualities of the wired version.Now for these wireless Smokin Buds II. I have paired them to 5 different devices: Motorola, Samsung Apple iPhones and an iMac. Sound and fit are excellent. There are 3 built in eq settings: standard, movie and music, that can be changed easily by tapping 4 times on the Skull icon on either earbud. As for the sound the bass seemed deeper on the wired version but not by much.There are small medium and large ear adapters. I believe I am using the smallest ones.There is a charging cradle. You can charge the cradle even when you are wearing the earbuds. When you put the earbuds away the cradle will transfer power to the earbuds without them needing to be plugged in.USB-C charging port with a short USB-A to USB-C cable.Fit: I have shaken my head and the earbuds didn't move. The fit is snug.I have not tried them with exercise yet.Pairing: touch one of the Skull icons for 3 sec. and you will hear ""ready for pairing""For $25 dollars these are excellent, Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024",AE6XURB2XGIU6KP2TRKMTMEW7NMA,1,20,Color: Matcha

R2B13J5B42HCX8,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars First Impressions,Whyborg,5,"Long time fan of Sony products. Have the WH-1000XM4, WF-1000XM4, and other brands. Just got these this morning and listening now. Pretty happy with sound quality, the Sony app helps as I like a punchy bass and have typical high frequency loss for male adults. Once set up with the app, clear bass turned up almost to max and treble up Im enjoying the sound. Sounds very much like the WF-1000XM4. Noise cancellation seems similar but need to do more listening in different conditions. Got the XM4 reconditioned and unfortunately the right battery is failing to hold a charge after about a year and a half so got these to satisfy my earbud itch until the XM5 is released. Actually liking the push button as opposed to the touch controls of XM4. Not better, but not worse. A bit smaller which Im pleased with as I like to sleep with audiobooks on. I can sleep on my side with a soft pillow and not feel very much pressure. Did have them pause as I have the right side on default to pause and skip but only once so far so I dont think it will be a problem. Contrary to some reviews either side can he configured to volume with the app. I have volume on the left now. Single press notches up, holding lowers volume. Default is to switch between noise cancellation or ambient mode. I have cancellation on most of the time so volume is more important to me. Also saw criticism about them not automatically pausing when removing, not a problem to me as I can easily pause touching the right side button. I also have some QCY buds that were surprisingly good for the price, and Soundcore A40 witch were also a good find, paid $99 but now $79. Theyre almost as comfortable as these for bed but protrude a bit further so when sleeping on my side more pressure on my ear than the Sony. So far noise cancellation on the Sony is the best, almost as good as the XM4.For the price, I think this is a very good alternative to the XM4. Battery life is rated to 7.5 hours and the Soundcore are rated to about the same but by early morning I get a rudely loud charging notification. Well see how the Sony last with similar use and update this review later. Overall in direct comparison of the XM4 Id say these are just about as good but maybe not as broad of a soundstage. If you like Sony or are just looking for a good quality earbud with noise cancellation at a reasonable price these would be a good selection. One major improvement for me is the tips for the buds. I have large ear canals and the memory tips on the XM4 were a huge disappointment, they would not seal in my ears which is terrible for sound quality and noise. I keep all the tips from many earbuds over the years and even with other brands need to dip into them to find larger tips to seal in my ears. Pleasantly surprised the included large tips actually fit me. I included a photo of the Soundcore, QCY, XM4, and the WF-C700N for comparison. The WF-C700N seems to be the most comfortable so far. Slightly smaller than the Soundcore and definitely smaller then the XM4.So after using these about a month Im still happy with them. I do have the occasional problem when listening to audiobooks in bed with the buttons for pause or volume getting just a little too much pressure and activating. Fortunately for volume one notch is louder but if you hold it the volume is reduced so at least I havent been blasted by max volume. Much as I like Sony products the other buds I mentioned would probably suit most people fine with a lower cost. But theyre not Sony! Still anxiously waiting for the soon to be released WF-1000XM5. Hoping for the lighter weight than the XM4 and the comfort of these with touch controls instead of push buttons. But for a mid-price bud these are still my favorites.Another update, these are not working for me to sleep with. My left ear gets a little raw spot on the edge of some cartilage. Im primarily using the Sony WF-1000XM5 )got them 2 weeks ago) and the Soundcore A40 for audiobooks in bed. The headphones until my ears get too hot and the A40s when I want to lay on my side.The Sony has some edge or something on it that makes a tiny little sore spot on the cartilage in my ear. Still like them a lot but now using them when I do my indoor cycling. I have a couple big blower fans on me and the Sony blocks out a lot of the noise and are better then the QCY Id been using. Theyre more rounded and I get less wind noise also.WF-1000XM5 just released, expecting mine Friday. I REALLY hope they dont irritate my ear the way these do.So Id still recommend these. Its probably just my personal ear shape causing me an issue, no problem on the right side but nobody is perfectly symmetrical&8/523Update. Got the XM5 2 weeks ago and loving them. Fantastic sound, lighter than the XM4, better bass, more comfortable. But again the tips dont fit. Airtight seal is critical on noise cancelling earbuds. The app is the same for The 700s and XM5 but the 700s do not have the feature enabled that checks for a seal. I discovered the left bud on the 700s and the new XM5 just wont quit seal. I found a hack to make the tips moldable. If you get Sugro glue (kind of like clay) roll a bit up, pull up the mushroom part of the ear tip, take the rolled up piece of Sugro and wrap it around the fitting to the bud, roll the tip back down and now you have a moldable tip. Insert in your ears and make sure they a good seal. You may have to reshape it a bit with your fingers if you work it too much. Once you have a good seal let it set a few hours and now you have a fitted tip. Works with my big ear holes&I have to reiterate, the 700s have a very pleasing sound once you get the equalizer and clear bass setting adjusted to your taste. I just finished using them for 4 hours straight on loud during a 2 hour indoor cycling session, walking the dog, and making my lunch. Enjoying music I havent listened to for too long. They were comfortable (almost forget theyre in) sound excellent, and just put them away with 50% battery left.I really think most people would like these and would not be disappointed in any way, especially at the price. The XM5 are better, but to most people probably not $200 better (but I love them too!).9/22/23 a note about the app and the codecs used. I feel like a dummy now that I finally noticed right at the top in the headphone connect app it tells me on my iPhone its definitely using the AAC codec and shows if DSEE is on or not. DSEE definitely improves the sound. Compared the noise cancellation against the WF-1000XM5 and the XM5 do a better job with the 2 blower fans I have on me during my indoor cycling. But I still prefer using the C700n just because I want to be very careful with the more expensive buds.10/23/23Lost these! Looked all around but cant locate. I was able to replace them @ $88 so not hugely upset, ordered a new pair and happy all over again. One of the reasons I really like these is how light they are. Even after 4-5 hours of wear I almost forget theyre in. Still one of my favorite pairs.Revisiting noise cancellation, walking my dog with light traffic only a few feet away Ive had the chance with the new pair (left button default is now toggle ANC transparency off or on. With it off Im not hearing much of anything but my music. In transparency mode I can hear everything around me. Id give these a 9 from 1-10. About as good as any ANC buds Ive tried.12/22/23Found the lost pair so now I have 2 pairs of the WF-C700n and not unhappy about it. These are definitely my go to buds, use them more than the XM5s as theyre so light and comfortable and now at $76 I dont worry as much about loss or damage as with the pricy XM5.

R11HJEV7XJYDDM,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for running and comfortable,Rick,5,"I typically run anywhere from 20min to 1 hour several times per week. I also sweat very heavily. To the point where clothes and towels are soaked.After trying half a dozen ear buds... The Sony c700n is the only one that stayed in my ear the whole time without falling. And they did so comfortably. The fit, comfort and grip is just phenomenal. It's almost as if Sony designed these for my ears. The default ear tips they came with the buds miraculously worked and I didn't even have to try the others.Some of the grip and stability is probably due to the weight of the buds as they are very light and sit very well in your ear.Flagship models are obviously fine but they have a huge disadvantage to runners since they are a lot bigger and heavier and therefore lose some grip and stability.The sound quality on the C700s is excellent as compared to my Galaxy Buds Pro 2. Honestly I can't tell the difference in quality. Even without the advanced codecs.ANC is probably where I see a difference compared to my Galaxy Buds. The Samsung ones are better but not by leaps and bounds. Id call the Sony c700 adequate and works sufficiently well at the gym to block most noise. With music on you won't hear any outside noise.Phone calls is an are where these struggled for me. I can hear other people just fine and clear... The issue is other people cannot hear me... Complaints I often hear is that I sound very far away and the noise cancelling for some reason does not work well during calls. Calls I made in moderately loud places were a near disaster. If you're in a quiet environment maybe they will work better. Hopefully they can fix this with a software update.I can't fault these buds though... I got them for sports/running and good audio quality... And for my use cases I am blown away! Especially at the price point.I prefer the push button interface rather than touch sensitive while running. This is because sometimes I need to adjust the buds without activating any commands. Touch sensitive earbuds are annoying for this matter. Sony designed the buttons well and they are easy to operate. It goes without saying that I can adjust the earbuds without accidentally activating any commands.The case could not be better for gym and sports. It is small, light and minimalist. Love the texture and they are small enough to keep in my pocket without noticing. Given the price point of the buds, I also wont mind if they get scratched of dented. The design is very practical and the ""rough"" plastic texture looks very nice to me.The app is very simple and works well. Besides software updates you can also adjust EQ to your liking. The app is very minimalist but gets the job done. I haven't explored the additional app features yet mostly because I don't think I have a use case for them.Buy these for the gym, very good audio quality and adequate but not stellar ANC. Do not buy these for personal or work phone calls.For the price, it is hard to believe the value these buds offer.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2023",AGUBP7OHOLRD4H67LLYJZLHRWHFQ,1,92,Color: Black

Lastly, the case, whole usable, it a pretty goofy shape. It's hard to hold, falls out of your pockets, stick out from what ever pocket you have like a dumb lump. Just kind of goofy and they can do better and they probably do for higher cost products. So this is probably punishment for being frugal.

R2D95JSE3TO700,B0BYPFNW6T,1.0 out of 5 stars Will not enter pairing mode. Ever. Horrible instructions.,Verskate,1,"Update: Feb 2024 After having these for about 6 months, I figured out the pairing issue. It's hard to explain but it is done using the Sony Headphones app and disabling the option for connecting to more than 1 device at a time.New issue - charging. Actually not new, but every now ant then the earbuds just won't charge. You place them in the container, the light turn on and glows green, then shuts off. All the while 1 or both earbuds will be just about empty on battery life. So you have to play the game of removing them from the case, placing them back in the case, over and over. That doesn't work all the time either, so then you need to plug them into a power source and remove/place in the case until you get a solid orange light that doesn't disappear in 2 seconds. It's a pain in the a$$. Especially when you know the case has a full charge and you want to use the earbuds only to find out 1 or both are dead. Huge let down from Sony. Calling their support line, maybe I can get a different pair. These suck.Maybe I just got a bad set, but these are the absolute most difficult earbuds that I've ever owned. I've factory reset them at least 5 times and have wasted a good 2 hours of my life trying to pair 2 different devices. The instructions to pair a second device are to place the earbuds in the case, leave the lid open, hold the button on the back for 5 seconds. Sounds easy right? Nope. It's not. The buds will not enter pairing mode. Ever. I can connect to the first device, but good luck with the second. One thing I did learn when I was able to get two devices to pair, that one time, was to be sure to disconnect the earbuds from the first device. Besides the over-complicated method of entering pairing mode, I've had the earbuds only connect one bud, on a few occasions. So you'll get 1 bud to connect, and the other is dead. Trying to get them both to turn on was another clunky nightmare and I ended up just factory resetting them. I'm done messing with them, and they're going back to hell where they came from.UPDATE - If you're using the ""Headphone"" app on an Android and want to connect to ""pair"" with a second device. DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON SONY'S WEBSITE. They will only mess up your earbuds and make you frustrated. In the app under ""status"" locate the ""Connected Device(s)"" and tap that. The next screen you'll see a + button on the bottom right. Click that! That will put the earbuds into pairing mode. Good lord they made that difficult. 2.5 hours later I have them paired.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2023",AEWFIZHWBDHIZY7EAHSDIM6SXYMA,1,36,Color: Black
R1MGV1XOWJJUS5,B0BYPFNW6T,"3.0 out of 5 stars Decent Sound, ANC Not For Airplanes",Artie Deco,3,"These are not bad. They fit my ears well. They are reasonably loud, but they won't be overpowering.The frequency response is pretty good. The associated phone app gives you some equalizer control that helps, too.There is some configurability for the buttons. Not completely customizable, as the actions are grouped across numbers of clicks (e.g. 1: pause, 2: next track, 3: previous track are a group). But I like the defaults, anyway.I also like the tactile buttons. You rarely accidentally push them while adjusting the buds, unlike touch buttons. There is definitely a significant delay for them to respond (I'm guessing a lot of this is waiting to see how many clicks you're going to do to determine which action to take), so the actual mechanical click lets you know you've pressed them.They did not hurt at all, even on 9-10 hr flights.And the battery life so far is crazy good. With ANC enabled, they were still about 15% after use for those entire long flights. Without ANC, they were like 80%! (That'll likely change with age.)But, the ANC is not useful for me. I bought these for airplane travel. A very old set of ANC headphones did wonderfully eliminating the airplane noise. These, not so much. They physically seal well, so they block sound pretty well with no ANC enabled. In the airplane, turning on the ANC changes the sound, but seems to trade one you can hear for another at roughly the same volume. On one 9 hr flight, this was a bit preferable. But it didn't make much difference on the other. They also didn't block crying babies better with ANC than without. However, they were plenty loud to drown out that noise with or without ANC.The passthrough mode is functional, but poor quality. It lets though the ambient sound, but it somehow boosts actual noise. Airplanes have air blowing all the time. Without the earbuds, you don't really notice it much. But with these in & turned to the monitor mode, the hiss of the air is very loud. But again, it's still functional for listening, even while being annoying.As mentioned, I bought these for airplane travel. I have Google Pixel Buds that have no ANC. Comparing to these, the seal is better with the Sonys, even though the ANC doesn't do much for airplane noise. And the equalizer allows adjustments that the Google Buds don't. Including the battery life & buttons, I've decided to keep these. But just be aware of the ANC limits.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AECD3NAKI2EFV3AV2WSRPK3ZRQFA,1,36,Color: Black

When one dies pop it in the case and use the other one. The build quality is also perfect, I'm a mobile mechanic for a living so I'm rough on my stuff these have worked perfect in the rain,been dropped etc. Touch controls are great I can usually use my shoulder to click pause if someone starts talking and I'm not hands free. You get alot of value for the money in my opinion compared to say the samsung buds I'm using til I buy another pair. If you check my screen shot my other pair of sonys lasted 1500 hours but I accidentally broke them as well.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AF5S2TNFHCKKBT5PQHPX4CZ44TWA,1,0,Color: Black

R1QMGR8WHUBKMQ,B0BYPFNW6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Beyond Expectations for Budget Earbuds,Trenton,4,"I can be pretty sensitive to noise, so I've been looking for a good, yet affordable set of noise-cancelling headphones for a while now, but have always been wary of cheaper models. I decided to give these a shot after listening to Sony's C720N's, and so far I've been pleasantly surprised!Noise-Cancelling:What really blew me away was the quality of the noise-cancellation for the price. I didn't have high hopes given that I only paid around $100, but after using these for the past week I've been pretty satisfied with their performance. I would say these earbuds are really good at filtering out lower-end noise, like fans, traffic, and TVs as well as more distant sound. I walked past an industrial AC unit on my way to work the other day and barely heard the thing, especially with music playing. These don't really excel with dealing with higher-end or particularly loud noises like close speech, dogs barking, or sirens, but they do significantly lower the sound, which is incredibly helpful for me. Turning the NC on with music playing is usually enough to block out the majority of offensive noise.Audio:The sound is also really well-balanced right out-of-the-box with good low-end and clear mids and highs unlike the flat or muddy sound you might get with other low-price headphones. Sony's app also allows you to customize your EQ further to get a mix that better suits your preferences, which is really nice. Speaking of the app, you can customize what the buttons on each earbud do through it and toggle the Adaptive Noise-Cancelling setting as well.Comfort:The earbuds themselves are honestly pretty comfortable and fit in my ears snugly. I don't feel them come loose at all as I'm moving about, and I can wear them for hours at a time without much issue. I haven't tried exercising or running with them yet, though. I have been running into a bit of discomfort in my left ear after a couple hours of wear, but I think that may have more to do with the shape of my ear since my right side is fine. I've just been letting the left earbud sit slightly away from the ear for now. which has been helping mitigate any discomfort with out sacrificing any noise-cancellation.Battery-Life:I use my earbuds with noise-cancellation on for at least two-four hours each day. When I'm done using them, they go back into their case to charge. In the week since I bought them, I've only had to charge the case twice. For me, that's not bad at all. The case has an LED indicator to let you know when your charge is getting low, and you can also check it via the app. Charging only takes a couple of hours.All in all, I've been pretty happy with these. I think they're a surprisingly good pair of earbuds for the price. The noise-cancelling of course won't compete for Sony's top-end models, but these do the job and they do it much better than expected.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AHQFE3IETHLN5VJGRSROS3ZIEGOA,1,36,Color: Black

The bigger annoyance is the unreliable charging. When I'm preparing to go for a run, it's a buzzkill to have one or both of the earbuds' batteries dead.

R54TAZM3P539,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars True ANR Nlise canceling,DD1550,5,"For those of you who want to purchase this product PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW. I'm going to try and make this short and accurate as possible. Many will tell you that the ANR noise reduction is just a bunch of white noise. THIS IS FALSE! This Bluetooth headset has two modes. ANR and a mode that is sort of a surround sound microphone mode. You can toggle between ANR and surround sound microphone mode with a single tap of the left headset button. You will know when you are in ANR mode because it will be very difficult to hear anything you are surrounded by while you have these headphones in your ears. You will also notice the sound of the music you are listening to is very sharp and clear with lots of bass. The surround sound micro phone mode helps you to hear the environment around you. They sort of turn into microphones and amplify surrounding sounds so you can hear them. This is too often misinterpreted as ANR white noise. Often when wearing these, you will get someone walking up to you talking, trying to communicate, but whatever they are saying will be inaudible if in ANR mode. If this happens, tap the left headset button once. This stops ANR mode and you will be able to hear them talking while still hearing music playing. For best results, tap the right headset button, it stops the music or whatever you are listening to. Then tap the left headset to get out of ANR mode so you can hear the person or environment you are in without removing the headphones from your ears. Its a really cool feature to have on these. The battery life is ok. My headphones will stop functioning at about 6.5 hours of use. Which is acceptable for me for the price. If 6.5 hours of use sounds ok for the price you pay for these, then get them. They are a good bluetooth headset for the money and DON'T LET THE REVIEWS WITH MISLEADING INFO BE A DECIDING FACTOR!!","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2024",AHDOGFOOXLQ6SC2NVWODUFM4QRRA,1,16,Color: Black
RWT29BUJJGM1V,B0BYPFNW6T,2.0 out of 5 stars For the Money - Not impressed.,Granular,2,"I bought these earbuds to replace a set from a different manufacturer that started to not accept charge after around 3-4 years.First thing I noticed was the clunky application you are encouraged to download to make the most out of the ANC and Audio features. The product comes with literature telling you straight up - Made for Iphone/Ipad.. Works with Android - so right away, I felt a sense of dread because I'm an Android user.Through the setup process, you are asked if it's cool that Sony collects all of that sweet information about who you are, how you use the device, your mother's maiden name, etc.I clicked yes, because the audio without the app was on par with the 20 dollar set you can buy at the gas station. WITH the app, you are then asked if you want to install ANOTHER app that will make full use of the ""capabilities"" of the new earbuds you just bought.. for ~$100.. and that you MIGHT have to pay the digital audio fluffers a subscription to use their services. I declined this option and decided to see what the Sony app could do to digitally optimize the sound quality with what I assume are cheap and (too) small audio drivers.Long story short:-The bass is lacking.. seriously lacking - you have to turn the bass setting up to max to achieve what I would consider normal for an in-ear earbud.-The mids and highs are ok - nothing special about the sound.-The active noise cancelling is ok - probably better than the set it was intended to replace (but those were 4 years old.. and older model when I bought them)If you're going to spend ~$100 for a set of everyday use earbuds, I would look elsewhere. The set of Jabra Elite Active 75T's this was supposed to replace blow these away in terms of audio quality (no I don't get paid to write reviews.. yes I only write reviews when a product fails to meet my expectations).Unfortunately, I need these for work over the next few weeks - so I won't be returning them.. but I am VERY Underwhelmed.-","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AH7EAOWJE7ETS2SCSOQDAI7OBHEQ,1,0,Color: Black

I got mine for under 100 dollars, which is basically a steal for how much I love them. I also can't get enough of the physical button on the side in lieu of just having touch controls. The buds are secured in the carrying case with very strong magnets. Would recommend if you aren't going exclusively for the noise cancelation. It's fine, but not class leading.

Combined with the Spotify equalizer, the bass is fantastic and so is the noise canceling and Id argue the sound quality is better than AirPods.For less than $150 these headphones were a great purchase and Id recommend them to anyone looking for a budget friendly headphone from a quality company.","Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2023",AGT64FVKLXX6SDPCFW5RTUCDMVWQ,1,6,Color: Black

The low end is more encompassing and punchy without ever compromising clarity and quality of the other frequencies.I was a bit concerned about the lack of frequencies available for the graphic eq but these concerns proved to be unwarranted as I don't need to adjust anything.These ear buds sound so good, I just leave the eq flat and adjust the ""clear bass"" function as needed for extreme music changes.These are my first noise canceling earbuds (as opposed to just noise isolating) so I can't compare to comment too much on the ability here but they definitely reduce background noise.The ambient mode is pretty handy when you need to hear what's going on around you.With the new software update, these modes (noise canceling, ambient, off) are switchable with a simple click of the ear buds (as well as many other customizable click functions).As well, the size of the earbuds / charging case is small enough to put in my jeans pocket and not be annoying or uncomfortable.I have only had these for a few days so I can't comment on longevity but so far, I am really enjoying these earbuds.There are a lot of features, amazing sound quality, high comfort level and all at surprisingly reasonable price point.

Like most Sony electronics, they're just a little bit better and more thoughtfully designed than the competition, in almost every respect, from the audio quality, to the crispness of the button press, to the way they snap effortlessly into the case, to the finish and feel of the plastics used in the buds and their case.The Jabras are slightly better acoustically and have wireless charging, but they're almost twice as expensive and have slightly less refined build quality. For example, the case is smooth plastic without any distinguishing notches to facilitate no-look use, and the buds are kind of confusing to put back.The Ankers are just great, too, but they're a shade less robust in audio quality and a little flimsier.

I recently wore them for six hours straight on a long (and delayed) flight, and they still had a 50% charge when I put them back in the case. While the noise cancelling function doesnt neutralize every single sound, they do a good job of quieting the drone of jet engines, air-conditioners, and tires. A pass-through feature allows you to hear other people talking when you need to. For phone calls, the call volume is too low, and of course your own voice is muffled by the in-ear design. The only real complaint that I have, however, is that is almost impossible to get them in your years without pushing the otherwise generously sized multi-function play button. Overall, Im quite happy with them.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2023",AH3DP2WBO7534LIK6EZMPJMHBCGQ,1,8,Color: Black

Better isolation, better sound, and no more constant fumbling with repositioning.The sound quality is good, not great. Very neutral to somewhat laid back sound, bass heads or people who like dynamic sound should look elsewhere. Noise cancelling is just ok, compared to a pair of JBL over ears, the JBL blew these out of the water. The fit and ergonomics are the most frustrating aspect. You get 3 eartip sizes, none of which really worked for me. But worst of all is the giant buttons which are nearly impossible to not trigger every time you have to touch the buds, put them in, adjust them, whatever. The flip case is also kind of clumsy to get them in and out of. Regret buying, especially for the money.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2024",AE7PSJ77NBHB4GSIPDLLQRANJYAA,1,0,Color: Black

Ive tried the different sized soft pieces but doesnt matter. They will still fall out. They are also so sensitive that putting them in my ear will easily turn off the noise canceling (on the left) or cause the right to stop working altogether (thats the problem one). I am constantly buying earbuds bc I lose the case and cant get a replacement (Bose sport), or have various connectivity issues until one just dies (Beats sport) or they are too delicate for being so expensive (Apple).

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,1,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R1EA1XXVYAUBNB,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars A simple, solid speaker",L,5,"If you want great sound in a simple package, this bluetooth speaker will do the trick. Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,1,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters  B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker  and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed.

I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical.

I am not a real audiophile by any means, but I know quality when I hear it, and this falls seriously short. It sounds very muffled, and a lot of midrange and high frequency is lost in this awful dishwater of muffled sound. Its reasonably loud for its size, but not very loud compared to better quality speakers of the same size. I have to wonder why so little of the whole device actually emits sound and why the other 80 percent is just rubber and plastic covering. All in all, its just kind of a piece of junk that looks like it could be nice.

R26NYYKTFM4AAF,B0B44F1GGK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful, great sound, good battery life, nice design",RedXepher82,5,"I really loved these bluetooth speakers as they are very durable, powerful clear sound, and look pretty nice. The first thing to note is that this is a wireless only device. It cannot be used with an aux cable so you need to use this via bluetooth. There is no real way to do a direct connected. That being said, if you are using a projector, you will need to be able to connect is via bluetooth. I have used it for my laptop via bluetooth it works great. The sound quality is really clear and has a pretty good base to it for the size. When it first arrived, the initial battery was around 50 percent. It lasted about four hours on just playing movie sounds alone from my laptop. Even with the bluetooth connection, it did not drain the battery too quickly. I charged it which took about three hours to get to full, but it all depends on what media you are using. When I charged it with my laptop, it took longer than it would with a wall plug or power hub. It does use a type c connector in order to charge the device. Afterwards, I tried pairing it via Bluetooth to my phone and the sound quality was amazing. There was no lag or static even from several feet away. The sound was crystal clear and had a good bass sound to it. The device itself isn't too heavy but it is a bit big so you are transporting it just know that. It will take a good amount of room in say your backpack. On Bluetooth from full charge I was able to use the speakers for several days on and off for 1 hour to 2 hours a day. The white color looks pretty nice and it is not as easy to see the scratches on the device. You do see it get visibly dirty and it is prone to sun damage. The material the device is made out of it is pretty sturdy but I wouldn't recommend dropping it. It is also not water resistant/proof so do not get it wet or you may damage the speakers. There is a really nice string hook that you can use to attach to your back pack or hang it. It is a really durable rope. Overall I think this is a great bluetooth speaker. It gives a good amount of range around 10-15 feet before losing any kind of sound quality and it last a pretty long time. It is definitely a must have if you like playing music on the go and it is a very durable speaker system. I do wish there was a way to connect it via wire but that is okay.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2023",AF6RFVIK2MSSR3PQTKQKAVK4HNRQ,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200

R3K1L360PPZ5YT,B0B44F1GGK,"4.0 out of 5 stars I have some issues, but for the most part I love it.",Rabbit,4,"For starters, I loathe Sonys obsession with the proprietary, whether it be software, chargers, or special headphones that you have to have in order to properly use your own stuff. It drives me batty. This speaker, of course, wants to use Sonys proprietary app for iPhone. Its horrible. Skip it. It doesnt do anything that Apple Music, Google Music, etc, cant. In fact, I can do a lot more for my equalization with the iPhones inbuilt music apps settings. It makes your phones battery drain faster, it doesnt help with Bluetooth connectivity, it serves no purpose aside to inflate Sonys proprietary status.Just utilize it like every other normal Bluetooth speaker. It has occasional hiccups and glitches in connection, which is weird, as Ive had super generic speakers that never have any issues whatsoever, but this little guy drops out for no reason for a few seconds at a time every so often. It doesnt make any sense. The app seems to make it worse somehow, maybe a latency in reading music files? I have no idea whats happening there. It needs to be sorted, but thats the only problem Ive had.That may seem like a big drawback, but to me it isnt. The occurrence of such dropouts are rare enough that I can ignore it. The sound quality is fantastic, as is the maximum playable volume. The sound can fill a rather large room with high ceilings with no problem. Thats fantastic, as I live in an old house with very tall rooms and wide open doorways. The battery life is decent, as I can usually get a good six hours or so out of a single charge at maximum volume. The blue colour is gorgeous and I love the slimline speaker look. It is pretty durable and has taken a couple of big knocks from falling off of my kitchen counter. The silicone covering is soft to the touch and easy to wipe clean and it charges with USB-C, so no proprietary bull there. It has an auxiliary jack, so I can use my old iPod Classic without using a Bluetooth transmitter.Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I havent tested its water resistance yet, as I dont really feel great about tossing my nice new things in a filled bathtub for funsies. So if you really want to find out how water resistant one of these bad boys is, be my guest, its your money. But I prefer not to find these things out the hard way, if you get my drift.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGQDJA57TXC7G6FZQP2GQY5VBAIQ,0,2,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE200
R1BSI08ET2JUBA,B0B44F1GGK,4.0 out of 5 stars A good rugged/waterproof speaker from Sony,Customer Review,4,"This Sony SRS-XE200 (Sony has the best product names, am I right?) is a tall cylindrical shape, but I don't think it has a 360 degree orientation like the old Amazon Echo speakers. This one fires out of the mesh on just one side, in one direction. If you have ever owned a pair of Sony earbuds or one of their sound bars, you will be familiar with their mobile apps. This one uses ""Music Center"" for changing any settings more advanced than changing the volume, this is also where you can update the firmware over bluetooth. This speaker supports Google Fast Pair, so if you have an Android smartphone, this makes pairing it super easy.The only negative thing about this speaker (from my perspective) is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack for using a wired connection. This is purely bluetooth, so make sure you are good with that. It has a built-in microphone for phone calls or summoning a digital assistant (Google Assistant/Siri/Alexa). It does have USB C port for charging, but you cannot plug it up to something like a laptop use it over USB. It has a rapid charging feature, 10 minutes plugged in will equal 70 minutes of playtime. The 16 hour battery life rating seems to be accurate in my testing, that assumes you would be listening at 50% volume (this is always the case for quoted battery life estimates).If you're curious about the drivers inside, as far as I can tell, it is just one full-range driver measuring:42mm x 51mm. But, I'm not 100% sure because on Sony's website, it shows a cutaway diagram that appears to have dual drivers. The default configuration in the app is mono, but this could be because the drivers are arranged vertically (if there are two of them).This speaker is ideal for taking places, it's designed to be very durable and it is IP67 water-resistant (assuming you keep the protective flap closed over the USB C port). If you need one to keep at home on a shelf, there are better options than this for the price, with better sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2022",AH35XWTFCCK7DEATASGPXWVNSETQ,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200
R224LNL344ZL4S,B0B44F1GGK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound in a perfectly sized package,unrealtrip,5,"I use Bluetooth speakers every day, and because of that I have gone through many different ones narrowing things down to what for me is an optimal everyday speaker when it comes to size, functionality, sound quality, and toughness. Like many people these days I attend a lot of online meetings, so a good clear microphone and the ability to hear voice audio well is important. I also like to listen to music throughout the day while I work, so it needs to sound good in that regard as well. Toughness is certainly a factor for a portable speaker as the possibility of dropping it or having it get knocked down is very real. And finally, the physical size and form factor is critical as it needs to be easy to grab and move to another room to bring a meeting or music with me.This Sony speaker hits every item on my list and then some. It uses USB-C for charging, the port hidden behind a secure but easy to remove rubber panel. The buttons down the side are easy to hit, and the indicator lights are clear and make sense. The microphone is your fairly typical micro-sized hole, though it works well for voice calls. When it comes to using it as a speakerphone, Im told by others that my voice sounds clear, and locally I find that the audio is loud and clear, and peoples voices sound natural. Music sounds very good and there is a companion mobile app which you can use to adjust the lows/mids/highs to some degree. In fact, the companion app has many other things you can adjust as well, and it isnt simply a gimmick.I havent tested the toughness beyond one of my kids accidentally knocking it off a table, but it didnt sound bad when it hit the floor, and the rubberized exterior seemed to do its job well at absorbing the impact. I like the tether it has, which is handy for grabbing it from to move it, and the shape of the speaker itself is also nice as it completely prevents it from rolling away. Sound is projected largely through the center, and it sounds good both standing up or on its side.Overall, Ive found this to be a near perfect speaker for my needs. Ive used it daily for almost a month now and I have no complaints whatsoever. The battery life is great, the sound for both music and audio calls is excellent, and the physical form factor works really well for a handy everyday speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AH55RDCKO4VFJSNTEGFNKMOHUBPQ,0,2,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200
R1G3SZE1QZVNVF,B0B44F1GGK,5.0 out of 5 stars My new favorite portable speaker,Ernest Stalnaker,5,"The only portable speaker I used for a few years was an Ultimate Ears Boom 2, which I loved. It had great sound and was small enough take anywhere. But the battery finally died and it could not be charged anymore. Since it was out of warranty, I needed to get a new speaker. So I decided to give this new Sony XE200 a try. I have a few pairs of high-end Sony headphones and have always been impressed by the audio quality of their products. I chose the XE200 rather than the XE300 since it was the smallest model they sell in this line. It's a bit larger than my UE Boom 2 was, but it's still small enough to carry everywhere. Plus it has an integrated strap that makes it simple to carry, secure to my backpack, or hang on a hook wherever I happen to be at the time. The audio quality is absolutely amazing with this speaker! It is definitely better than my UE Boom 2, and I was very happy with how that one sounded. The range is better, probably because it has a newer version of Bluetooth. The battery life is better as well. Overall this is the perfect speaker for me. I can listen to high-quality audio wherever I go. It is also a great conference room speaker, thanks to the excellent microphone that is built in. If you need a small speaker that is portable but sounds just as good as much larger speakers, I don't think you'll find anything better than the Sony XE200.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AFKD6XBSKL6VCRHFPFIHZUCMIZFA,0,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE200

What you should know: The Sony SRS-XE200 is a loud little speaker, but with no bass. Battery life is good, but you are really paying for the IP67 rating with this one.The Good: This speaker feels like a quality product. The outer rubber coating is soft to the touch and feels like it will last through the elements. The other materials used is a mesh webbing pattern that gives it some style and flare. The buttons on the side are simple and easy to understand. They feel good when you push them in. The included strap is awesome, Sony did not cheap out on the materials. It should hold up through many uses without fraying for a long time. The blue color way is very vibrant and just pops amongst so many other darker colored speakers. The setup is super easy, you dont need to download the Sony app if you dont want to. If you do download the app, you get some other sound features. The weight of this speaker seems to be light compared to some others in the category. You can just through this in your beach bag or backpack and not worry that its taking up too much room.The Bad: The sound quality is just okay. This does get loud to fill up a room in the house, but the bass is so tiny I wouldnt recommend full volume.

The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy  its deep and punchy without being overwhelming. Ive had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch.

Ive taken it to the pool and the beach, and its held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound.

Both doo fine for background music at work, but I find myself dragging this JBL with me to friends' houses, to the pool, out on the patio.Bluetooth to my phone, pick a Spotify playlist and I'm see for the day.This has an extra charging port on the back to keep my phone running while playing at the pool all afternoon - A nice feature (not tried it yet) but the speaker itself runs all day and never run out of juice.It's lightweight, easy to carry along.The two-sides have a passive radiator that enhances the low-bass (I know the Bose has good low bass too).","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AF5YEU3L67F4XRAWXNIYMLSVTOIA,1,6,Color: Black

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4YMTPM,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15 feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to stereo mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5s anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since thats the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to forget device on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,1,20,Color: White

R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by Im old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands& I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelins- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. Id like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing dont overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and Im sure youll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,1,2,Color: Black

I like music when Im working so sound quality is important to me. Id say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks.

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here....

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,0,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldnt say its the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but Im interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because its sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. Its minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a better speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, dont complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that its the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass youll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, dont even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, its kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,0,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Just something I can set on the shelf by the shower and jam out to without worrying about it getting wet. I misplaced my old one years ago and I always liked the pill shaped form factor.Fast forward to 2024, and we have a brand new Beats Pill that is redesigned from the old model. You still get the pill shape, but now there's some nice updates like the lossless type C listening, improved bass drivers and larger battery capacity...about of days worth of Beats now!The packaging and design are definitely exquisite...it is an Apple product, and it shows in the design and style. There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass. It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound, which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp.The verdict?

If I cant adjust my eq to make that happen (different songs have different settings) then I dont keep it.This little speaker just sounds good.

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface.

RUL2NHT5AJZTD,B01IOD7KB6,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed in almost every way - Don't buy!,Danny,2,"Attracted the successful marketing/branding pitch (""House of Marley"") and by the numerous positive reviews, I decided to purchase this speaker, despite its relatively high price in a product category with a huge number of high quality competitors. This was a mistake, and I am quite disappointed. Except for its look and styling, which I like very much (except for the exceptionally large and bulky size and weight, which I don't), there is nothing else that I like about this speaker:Sound quality - very tinny, almost unpleasant. I often listen to podcasts, and the default sound quality borders on unlistenable. I have to manipulate the equalizer settings on my phone app to be able to listen, and I have to do this every time. Very annoying. The situation is only slightly better when listening to music. Even my little first-generation Oontz Angle sounds better! In fact, my experience is at such odds with the reviews, that I wonder if I have a defective product.Size: I knew when I ordered that this was a larger system than most others in its quality and price range, but I guess I should have looked more closely at the dimensions, which are, for a ""portable"" system, huge and heavy. Maybe some people like this - not me. Much too big, much too heavy.Battery life - haven't measured it, but it is MUCH shorter than any other portable bluetooth speaker I have owned, and this was true right out of the box.Connection and operation: it works okay, but is annoyingly non-intuitive.Conclusion: poor sound quality, too big, short battery life, non-intuitive operation. There dozens of alternatives that will give you much better quality and satisfaction, for a lot less money. Stay away from the House of Marley, at least this particular product.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2018",AEJUHFEP7FRKBCAMWYULJID43ITA,1,3,Color: Signature Black

R1RRZB90F1VYQI,B01IOD7KB6,3.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is poor.,Patrick Porter,3,"Ive had this speaker for almost a year, in which time Ive used it indoors and out too many times to count. Ive also read pretty much every review on here, so Ill touch on some of the more frequent concerns.Sound quality: 1/5 very flat sounding with almost no bass and lackluster mids. Generally makes your music sound dull and lifeless. It does get fairly loud if you need it to, though. Acoustic music sounds alright, but thats about it...Connections: 5/5 Ive had no issues with the Bluetooth or aux port on this. Never drops or cuts out from my apple or android devices. Sounds like QC is a bit problematic though, as lots of people have had issues in this department.Portability: 2/5 No covers for the speakers always makes me nervous when taking this anywhere. Just waiting for the day I get a pen through it or something. Battery adds a point though, because it has been reliable and lasts as long as advertised.Build: 4/5 Everything looks like it was put together well. Materials are nice. Good weight to it.Other: I am constantly annoyed that this doesnt have a remote. I just want to turn it on and pair without getting up...","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2018",AFYB3LGAEKCS6ASTYBQFRKOTMAGQ,1,5,Color: Signature Black

I guess to save battery power but I have it plugged in and find it very annoying to get up every five minutes (when not in use) to turn it back on. A remote or an over ride on this feature would be helpful. Five minutes of silence is all...don't get too comfortable, or take too much time to decide on what you want to listen to...five minutes....quick before it turns off...really annoying. Fall asleep and let it go quiet for five and then there's a good loud beep to wake you up.

It will no loner charge, or even work while plugged in. It is a total brick. Extremely p*ssed off! Stay away!!So, I learned about this speaker cause a friend and I were at a new bar that had just opened and they didn't have their permanent speakers wired up yet. We saw this cool speaker, and both looked at each other and basically said, ""no way all this sound is coming from only this speaker!?"" And it was. I ordered one the next day. It's great, connects to BT on iPhone right away, range is on par with most better BT products, 30' +/-. Audio is very good for what it is, definitely above average. I also have a little Yamaha BT speaker (don't recall what model) and the Marley blows it away. I have heard some from JBL that sound good, the Marley is better. And above all else, the Marley is gorgeous Very well constructed, nice organic materials (no plastic here), nice to touch and look at.

R2N9LGOT33J14T,B08YRT9T38,4.0 out of 5 stars A Posh Music speaker!,RT - Gadget Guy,4,"B&O makes posh high end audio gear&.gear which showcases the most avant-garde design which would be at home in any modern art museum (MOMA indeed has some of the past B&O iconic products in their exhibits). Normally their gear is priced out of the range of normal-average-hard-working folk ($10000 speakers for example), but with this product, you can get to experience a slice of the life of the upper 0.1%!In all seriousness, this is a regular tiny Bluetooth speaker which has a price at least 5X more than your average tiny Bluetooth speaker. So what do you get for that premium? First, the whole shell is made of metal. It feels cool to the touch. It has hard Type II anodization on the aluminum shell which will help resist scratches, and should take the hard knocks while its hanging off your backpack using the supplied carabiner clip. The speaker is IPX67 meaning its water and dust resistant. You can immerse the whole thing into water for a very short period even.Soundwise, this is a tiny speaker so dont expect much in terms of volume and thump. It will start to distort if you try to turn it up too high (it's not going to fill a large room in your house). It sounds smooth and the tonality is slightly warm (you hear less of the treble and more of the midrange). Deep bass is nonexistent, but theres just enough of upper bass tones that you can follow the rhythm of the beat. Measurements on other review sites show that it doesnt reproduce any content below 100Hz. Basically, it doesnt reinvent any laws of acoustics and still sounds like a small speaker. But the overall sound quality is clean and the tonality is pleasant. its a portable speaker that you can carry with you anywhere, so you can have some music while boating, at the beach, hiking, camping etc. It just works!Battery life is good, at lower and moderate volumes, it easily lasts 10+ hours. Controls are simple: power, volume, play/pause/skip forward backwards. It isnt necessary to install the app but the app is useful because it gives you the exact battery percentage, turn-off the auto-standby feature if you dont want it, and has some presets to select a different sound signature or alternatively you can fine tune the strength of the treble/midrange/bass precisely by moving around a slider into four quadrants on the screen. I think it sounds fine with the default optimized preset. Also as a bonus, you can plug this into your computer with the USB and used it like a wired USB speaker. You can pair two Bluetooth devices to it, which is the norm nowadays.So is it worth it? By the way, I bought this at a 45% discount (check amazon price history for this product) and even though its still not inexpensive, I feel it is good value. Even if it had cost more, I would not have been disappointed. I dont mind paying more for something that feels like its going to last, and with B&O, you get some cutting edge design with great sound engineering.This is a 5 star product, but minus 1 star just because I would have liked to have a microphone so that it acts as speakerphone. Also, because of the bluetooth profile, your device won't show the battery percentage on the phone itself, you have to view the percentage in the app. And the sound is good but it doesn't manage to break any laws of physics (not blaming the speaker but I had hoped that it would really stand out among other small speakers of this size with the bag of tricks that B&O geniuses have up their sleeves. The result is merely very good rather than exceptional). So result is 4 out of 5","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AE6TVTGGPRUEMJMSIV5SX6NDA2PA,1,7,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I have a Harmon kardon gen 1 or 2 Bluetooth that sounds excellent. I have an Audi A 5 convertible with a B and O sound system that is just the best thing ever. I had never heard B and O until I got the Audi. So. Now I have refurbished a vintage travel trailer and wanted some killer sound while Im camping. Its a small space so I dont need anything like the Harmon Kardon. Plus that needs an outlet. So Im thinking what does B and O offer in a small package? I got this speaker for $118 because of the gray color I guess. It was cheaper than black. I downloaded the app. And with some adjustments to the bass /treble on the app I was able to get a satisfactory sound. Was I blown away. Sadly not. I was expecting a lot more from B and O. Even if its just a wireless speaker. Its not bad by any means. And I guess for the price its a good value. I guess Im comparing it to my Audi stereo system which is just amazing. >) I can crank it to infinity and its crystal clear. I like crisp sound that I can distinctly hear all the beautiful components. Is that too much to ask for in a wireless Bluetooth speaker from the infamous B and O? Like l said its not bad any means. But I guess my expectations were too high. It can be cranked to a point. But Id like it louder. Anyway. Just my rambling thoughts.

First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc. You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesnt really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious.

As an avid audiophile with a penchant for high-end audio equipment, I was excited to add this to my collection. The build quality is exceptional, a true testament to the craftsmanship that went into its design. However, when it comes to the volume, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The sound it produces, while undoubtedly of high quality, is a bit subdued for my taste. As someone who values the intricacies and nuances of audio, I expected more power and presence. While I appreciate the materials and construction, the volume, and the bass issue leaves me wanting more. While I understand the need for portability, the subdued volume simply doesn't cut it for me. Music should have the power to fill a space, to move people, and to evoke emotions, and this speaker falls short in that department. It's crucial for me to have a device that can truly capture the essence of my music, and unfortunately, this one falls short in that regard for those reasons I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AFUJHHCQZAAFBM6YYCAIOHJOIIBA,1,10,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

The price seemed a bit eye-watering, but I was really attracted to the battery life (a must for me), the design (very modern and durable), and the fact that is wasnt a smart speak. I purchased the speaker, and downloaded the B&O app. The app is a MUST if you want ANY bass projection at all. Everything about this speaker is perfect for me&..except for the bass. There just isnt any bass! Even with the app settings set to product as much bass as possible, the Explore just cant deliver. Ultimately, this is a disappointment, as the price tag just doesnt justify the sounds quality. All B&O need to do is add a little more bass for a perfect  if expensive  speaker! A it stands the JBL Flip 6 is the perfect speaker in this category and is only about $100  so half the price of the B&O Explore. Here hoping B&O will make a Explore 2.0 with more bass, but will retain everything else that makes this speaker so cool.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2023",AHQTQTOQV5PGD55DUMHONIDGOHCQ,1,19,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

The clarity of sound is great, the battery life seems very long and the look and feel is very solid. I also have a Bose SoundLink, and Bose is significantly louder, and has much more bass, at the expense of the battery life, I guess. Bose has one speaker though, while B&O has two, which doesn't help such a small speaker much.So overall I prefer the Bose sound, but I generally like B&O products so I kept B&O for a small form factor and long battery life.","Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2023",AF2CHKRGBC7M52D3MNI7COMGIMBQ,1,10,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

R9WE6G9SFHCUV,B08YRT9T38,5.0 out of 5 stars This is the best Bluetooth speaker Ive purchased.,Harry J,5,This speaker is amazing. I got it on sale. The price for this speaker I feel is worth every penny. The speaker does have weight to it. Not too heavy but because it is made out of quality metal it adds weight compared to cheap plastic ones. However that weight provides better sound since there is no rattling like plastic speakers. Its a great size and looks amazing wherever you put it. It performs great in small rooms but in large rooms if you put it towards the center of the room it really fills the room. The sound is incredible for something so small. The quality of the sound doesnt change as you turn it even all the way up. I was really impressed at what a clean sound it has. I do move it from room to room and bought it primarily for around the house but have also used it outside and taken it with me. Because its metal and looks so good and I want to keep it that way when putting it in a bag I put it in a small case type bag. However I havent been overly careful sign it around the house and even dropped it and nothing happened to it. The strap is well made also and really convenient and looks good because its well made as well. I had high expectations because the company makes great products but it even surpassed those expectations. I get endless compliments about it and have had friends order one right after seeing and hearing it and they were surprised at the price not being much higher.

But lack of basic functions make it a waste of money, especially as it wastes so much time. It usually powers on at full volume, no matter how volume is adjusted on the device its connected to.And adjusting volume from your device is randomly not an option. also you need to download an app to use it at all. If more than one device has it saved, you dont get to decide which device the speaker will connect to. Mid-play, the speaker will switch to the other device, then in order to switch back, youd have to forget the speaker on one device or turn off Bluetooth. It takes a very particular situation for uninterrupted and dramatic comedy-free playback.

R16YFTNSO98JTM,B08YRT9T38,2.0 out of 5 stars Awesome! (&for a year&),alrightalrightalright,2,"Im super picky about my Bluetooth speakers. I used to have a wonderboom and was happy with it until it finally croaked. I wanted something with long battery life, that was waterproof and decently rugged, and that had good sound quality. I initially bought another wonderboom but hated it! I did tons of research because I needed to replace it with something. I bring my little speaker everywhere and use it all the time. Im so glad I gave this a shot. Its perfect for my needs. I expected good sound quality, but I think that the sound quality on the Beosound Explore is *great* when you consider where its coming from. Everything is super balanced, and the app is useful if you want to do a bit of fine tuning to the EQ. It charges via USB-C. And I love that it comes with a little strap and carabiner. I use that all the time, actually, and its super convenient. The design and craftsmanship on the whole is stunning, and something I really appreciate. I feel like the machined aluminum casing probably lends to the sound quality this little thing can produce, but Im not a sound engineer so this is just speculation. I got this for a steal of a deal on prime day - I think I paid like $130. For that price, I dont think theres anything better. If this speaker had a microphone, I think that would take it to the next level and make it worthy of some extra cash, but its not something I really need. My only two gripes are the design of the top - it collects water since there is a lip around the edge. The other is that it did sound a little tinny once when I probably turned the volume up way too much on one particular song - by way too much, I mean all the way up, like 100%. So unless you frequently do that, youll probably never experience it.Update 1 year and 2 months later - the speaker has started failing. It is distorting whatever audio I try to play. I have not done anything crazy with this - its never been dropped or exposed to any really extreme environments. Super upset as now I need to find a new portable Bluetooth speaker, and I wont be going with B&O this time :(","Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2023",AG2NJCF7CFJ5FYZFKXRSFHKZR5JA,1,23,Color: Grey MistStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I mainly listen to classical music and popular music.I pick Explore because it has the ability to present the music I love in a very good and pleasant way.Sound quality:Boses sound is nice, but it is too emphasized on bass that the music became incorrect. Sonos Roam is a close runner-up, but its sound is too soft in the bass and too puncture in the middle. Emberton is great for the popular music but for classical music, some wind instruments sound a bit wrong. The A1 from B&Q is surprisingly a bit spread out that the focus went too far. Explore is a small speaker that has the fault of closed up sound that every small speaker has, but it shows the ability to produce a pleasant balance that I love.Functions:The last thing I want is they recording my shower singing in those Alexa/Siri enable smart speaker, so this speaker is best for privacy concerns.I recommend you download the app and play around to find the sound you like!

Even in a small room, it sounded a bit muffled and lacked clarity and crisp. I would recommend the Zeppelin Wireless instead. You can only use the Beosound via Bluetooth and not wifi. I like that the app has the radio feature that lets you access radio stations in your area, or even worldwide plus the option to pick a genre. That's an added plus for me.

Im a musician and I usually dont want too much of anything, but there is absolutely no bass! And dont be fooled by the comments recommending to use the app to add more bass, that adds barely anything. So even with blasting the bass on the app all the way up, there is no bass at all. I dont expect a small speaker like this to have a nice sub level, but having no bass at all, it sounds like only your treble (highs) would play back the music and there is no body to the sound.I still have it 5 stars for overall because they handled the return very professionally.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2022",AGTGRFHWPRAVTBBJJOGPW63T46NA,1,6,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

R2N9GZ6YLXIHZ6,B08YRT9T38,1.0 out of 5 stars Dont waste money in B&O crappy products,DMONVE,1,"I recently purchased a Bang & Olufsen speaker, attracted by its sleek design and premium external materials. Initially, I was impressed by its aesthetics. However, my experience quickly soured as the battery stopped working, making it the fifth quality problem I've encountered with a product from this brand.In all honesty, I found this Bang & Olufsen speaker to be disappointing. The brand's reputation suggests top-tier products, but this speaker left much to be desired. The fact that this is my fifth quality problem with a Bang & Olufsen product strongly suggests a recurring issue with their quality control and reliability.While the designs and external materials are undeniably cool and visually appealing, it's clear that the internal components don't match up. When it comes to speakers, the sound quality is paramount, and in this aspect, I was underwhelmed. The claim that older products from competitors like Bose, Marshall, JBL, and Sony perform better and offer superior sound quality even with cheaper exterior materials holds weight based on my experience.In conclusion, I would caution potential buyers to think twice before investing in expensive products from the Bang & Olufsen brand. While they excel in aesthetics, the quality and performance of their speakers may not meet your expectations, and the fact that this is my fifth quality problem with their products suggests a larger issue within the brand. There are more reliable alternatives available in the market.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AGR7LJUYQZ5HEIV24E6S6WXHSUTQ,1,12,Color: GreenStyle: Bluetooth speaker

The treble is in no way smooth or clear and the bass is almost inaudible (even with the B&O app tuned for the most bass possible).The songs I used to test this speaker's high and low ranges were:- Nonstop: Drake- Tip Toes: half alive- Natural: The Driver Era- bad guy: Billie Eilish- Correct: MNEK- Old Town Road: Lil Nas X (feat.

R3W0SAGT4F2CDC,B0BZ9WMLNQ,3.0 out of 5 stars decent,Guru,3,"On the positive side, the sound quality of these earbuds is impressive. The audio is clear and well-balanced, making them great for listening to music, podcasts, and phone calls. The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless with Android devices, and the quick pairing feature is very convenient. Additionally, the fit is comfortable, and they stay secure during workouts and daily activities.However, there are a few drawbacks that affect the overall experience. Firstly, the touch controls can be overly sensitive and sometimes unresponsive, which can be frustrating when trying to pause, play, or skip tracks. Secondly, the battery life, while decent, doesnt quite match up to some competitors in the same price range. I found myself needing to recharge them more frequently than I would have liked.Another issue is the lack of noise cancellation. While they do an okay job at passive noise isolation, they struggle in louder environments, which can impact the listening experience in busy settings. Additionally, the absence of volume control on the earbuds themselves is inconvenient, requiring me to use my phone to adjust the volume.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AFZ62B2ONA6QTX6J5M6MRVL7Q3KA,1,1,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds

They have almost fallen in the trash, down the sink and in the litter box when I have leaned/bent over. I am not using these buds during physical activity such as running or working out, this is just in the kitchen while cooking or doing household chores. This is inconvenient and aggravating. If I did some research, I am sure I could find other shapes in ear fittings to remedy this issue, and this issue does not reflect on the quality of the headphones themselves.Two, the battery life. For music and talking on the phone, I find the battery life to be as much as one should expect but not as much I would want. I hope the Pro buds have longer battery duration. I use my ear buds everyday, for as little as an hour/2 hours for talking on the phone, or as long for music. I understand not everyone will need to be on the phone as long as I do, but if you were looking for these for working from home or instead of a headset at work, they aren't advisable for that.Three, the noise filter/cancelation. When using in the car, I have had complaints of the road/wind/traffic being louder than my voice to the person am talking to. Also, I have had complaints that noises like doing dishes/opening a bag to add to the trash can is extremely loud to the person on the other end. For noise cancelation, I think it does decent enough but I think the feature the Pro has called Transparency mode where you can fade in/out of cancelation would be more useful.These are comfortable in your ear when they aren't popping out, the sound quality of the music and the voice of the other person on a phone call is great. The voice assistant I haven't used much but it's been very responsive when I have used it. I can't call my husband via voice because he is saved as 'hubby' in my contacts, and when I ask Google to call Hubby, she says, ok what's your husband's name? then can't find him in my phone. Oh well. All in all these headphones are worth getting over off-brands, but I would save for the Pros if I was honest.","Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2022",AF7LQSBFPTYESEVB3N3NKS6IM4PA,1,45,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

Used exclusively for gym, elliptical (watching videos on tablet) and running (mostly sprint intervals), with MP3 player, not phone.. I am not listening to violin concertos, just trance/rock music, generally with a fair amount of background noise, so sound quality doesn't need to be concert hall quality. Isolation could be better, but lots of runners don't like isolation for safety reasons. Wing keeps them firmly in place without being uncomfortable to me. Easy to load music, easy to connect to mp3 player and tablet, easy to make Bluetooth connection, no interruptions even when in shorts pocket and running hard. Only thing it lacks from my standpoint is volume control link to mp3 player, find myself sometimes have to grab player and adjust volume (volume variation likely attributable to download variations). I have had such a satisfactory experience with these I have considered upgrading to the Pixel Buds Pros which have touch volume controls, but I worry about them falling out during runs, and also price at 50-100% more, not sure they would be worth it.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024",AEKZM63RGQN5QMHLQC4ZIUQHV3YA,1,1,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

And I just had to get myself a pair.The Good:- battery life is solid- sound quality punches well above the class of anything else you could pick up for the price I got them at ($40 on sale)- pairing is dead easy (on Pixel phones)- USB-C charging, unlike many other budget wireless buds- I've never lost the connection of one earbud and then had to reset and pair again like I have with other buds- touch controls are good, sensitive but not too sensitive, and work wellThe Meh:- removing one earbud pauses whatever you're watching or listening to. I wish I could switch that off sometimes. Sometimes, I just want a single earbud in! And having to find a place to put the other earbud that triggers the proximity sensor to let things keep playing can be a bit of a hassleThe Bad: if you order them in different colors, say, for yourself and another person, the cases will look very similar.

R2OQM5XLDBPKDP,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars They do the job for what I needed,N. Arr,5,"I'll be honest, I loose technology....often. As a result I never bought expensive earbuds. I would always buy the $30 and under option because inevitably I was going to misplace them and could not stomach the idea of loosing a $100 item within a few weeks of purchase. However after 3 years of COVID required zoom calls my coworkers chipped in and bought me the Google pixel buds. There was an immediate difference for me in regards to what I could hear and the experience for anyone talking to me on the other side. Here are the highlights1. The noise cancellation works well. In the past people would complain they can't hear me clearly because of all the background noise. As if I were at a construction site when I simply was opening a bag of chips!2. Sound quality is perfect. Can't tell you how many times with other earbuds I would be told can you get closer to the phone, or that I sounded far away, or was I underwater etc etc. But with these it's Crystal clear no issues at all.3. Battery lasts long enough. I find that these last most of my work day. I tend to average about five hours of meetings a day and in that capacity they last.4. Charge speed is quick. When I do need to charge these for from 0-100% in like 20mins. To be fair I don't think I have ever let them get to 0. Overall I don't find myself charging them often and the charging case really does do a good job of charging the actual buds quickly if I do run into a problem.5. Ear buds do slip out. I have found an occasion that a slight tap will accidentally send the earbuds falling out of my ear. I've changed the size of the ear cushion but doesn't really seem to lock in well like other earbuds I have tried. So that is one point off for them but nothing insurmountable that would detract from the overall score.Overall for the price I think these are great. So much so that I did in fact lose the ones my coworker bought me within about 6 weeks and ended up buying my own pair thankfully they were on sale.

R2N6GLU60E0O70,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars They're FINE.,Quentin,5,"Ok, so I really only bought these because I was curious about the difference between the $10-20 earbuds I was used to using (with no real functional complaints) versus a more expensive, near-premium experience. I had also just bought a Pixel phone, so I figured, what the heck, let's get the ecosystem since I'd never fully done that before (I also bought the Pixel watch). And honestly, while they're fine and the audio is great and the easy connection to a Google phone is convenient, I'm not sure it's $60-80 better than the cheap stuff we buy and replace all the time. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's nice to have Google assistant on call, handsfree, especially after I've gotten so used to using it at home that I sometimes call out to Google in public places only to catch myself mid Hey Goo-."" But honestly, most earbuds at least allow you to press and call Google or Alexa, so again, my quibble isn't we with the buds being good. They are. But if you're a practical spender like me and also have a tight budget (or just don't want to spend more than you have to), I'd put it like this: these earbuds are more than worth the money if calling Google assistant anywhere, at anytime with just a whisper is super important to you. Otherwise, save a few bucks and get something in the $40-60 range and you'll still get 95% of what comes with these. But if you have the money to spend and don't care too much, yeah, these are fine. They fit fine, they last for a decent amount of time, and the charging case feels premium. But I was a bit underwhelmed after using em for a bit because I guess I expected something that would fundamentally raise my expectations for earbuds moving forward and I don't think these did that. I'll probably still switch between these and my $10 buds from time to time, probably keeping these in the car since the house wired with Google inside.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2022",AGJSG3XDDL5RCKG5D646IJTVF3TA,1,40,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds
RF574C7KF8UQK,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars By far the best pair of earbuds/phones I've ever owned,BTC,5,"The Pixel Buds are unquestionably the best set of ear-anything I've ever owned. Combined with my Pixel 6 XL, the buds are picked up instantaneously upon being removed from the case. The battery life is excellent and the case holds several additional charges. Thus far I've never run out of a charge. Not even sure I've gone below 75%, honestly.The best part about these, which can't be said for many other buds, is that you don't have to pair them to use them. You can use one of them and then switch over to the other if you want to maximize battery life (or simply don't want to or can't use both at the same time). This feature is often reserved for buds that are much more expensive than these.My final comment - and perhaps the most important - is the fit. Absolutely perfect. I have avoided buds over the years at all costs because I can just never get them to sit right in my ear. They fall out, they hurt, whatever. I do a lot of work around the house and get sweaty (I live in Florida, tough not to be sweaty...) and have had buds just drop out of my ear because of that. Never has that happened yet with these buds. They're so comfortable you can forget they're even in there.Do yourself a favor and pick these up.

I've really enjoyed them and use them every day when I'm cooking breakfast. They might get up to 1 hour a day use from me. The sound quality is very good, they are comfortable in the ears, and I like how well they work with my Pixel phone. I like the appearance, charging case and fit/finish of these more than AirPods.Recently the left earbud lost at least 50% of its volume, and is fading more every day. It's the same thing that happens with cheaper wired earbuds after a few months... volume loss, then eventually it stops working all together. So I was disappointed that the same thing seems to be happening with these Pixel buds, which are not cheap earbuds. I take care of my earbuds and keep them clean and free of debris, so that's not the issue. Apparently these aren't built to last. I had expected these to last as long as AirPods, but that's not been my experience.One other issue I've had with them is that often when you place them back in the charging case, they don't charge. Next time you go to put them on, they don't work because they will completely discharge on their own. Apparently there's an issue with the earbud's charging pin making contact with the one in the charging case -- it doesn't always make contact. Thankfully, the case's LED blinks to let you know when it's detected the earbud and is charging it, but you just have to make sure you watch it. It often takes me a few tries before I can get it to work. This has been an issue as long as I've had these. It's only a minor annoyance and I suspect it's a minor design flaw that they'll eventually remedy in manufacturing.","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023",AE6VEADNLEN5YHTMN4MSR6IB75IA,1,19,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds

I've really enjoyed using these. I have unusually small ears and they hurt after a while if I haven't had them in. If I wear them a lot, my ears get used to them. I love that they have the little wing to keep them in place so I don't have to worry about them falling out! My only complaint is that they can be difficult to pair. There is a really specific process you have to follow and the earbuds have to be placed a certain way so they are connecting with the case the right way in order to pair. Make sure to get familiar with the instructions! You also can't control the volume if you are connected to a PC which I found really strange.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2023",AE45IY2JVXGSGDLUTXJK2ICMOXCQ,1,6,Color: SeaStyle: Pixel Buds
R15JA925H18HFP,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Yes please.,Fiddleleaf,5,"I love these earbuds. I LOVE THEM.I've always been an over the ear earbuds wearer. I hate inner ear earbuds. They've never been comfortable for me, and my ears have always hurt after wearing them. I've tried different sizes to make sure the fit was good, but it just never felt right in the past.I received my first pair of earbuds for free from Google with the purchase of one of their phones a year ago. I was super skeptical, but hey. It was free.When I tried them on, I was so surprised. They were comfortable, and they actually stayed in my ears. They didn't fall out. The grip was strong, but it didn't feel like I was wearing anything at all. After I tried wearing them on a few walks with my dogs to make sure they didn't hurt my ears from prolonged use, I was super happy with the results. No discomfort. No pain. Heck yeah! These were my new favorite earbuds.Six months later, I left my earbuds out on the coffee table while I was doing some cleaning. When I came back in, I discovered one of my dogs had gotten them and chewed them to pieces.So here I am. I immediately came to Amazon and bought a new pair on the spot, because I need these in my life. I got my new pair, and they're still as comfortable as ever.5/5, don't leave them near your dogs.","Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2023",AGNEEFBKM3UREFXD4DZTMSCBGO3Q,1,37,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

However, these buds were sort of a let down when it comes to the buds holding a charge. I can't get through a workday of meetings without my buds dying. Total sad face. But otherwise, the sound is smooth with the bass hitting just right for a broad selection of genres (although I don't listen to country), the fit is nice, and the setup is super easy once you get the hang of it. I can easily switch from my phone to laptop with ease. The case doubles as a sensory tool during meetings or while out walking. Charging the case takes a minute but it holds a charge well once it's fully charged. I think I've been able to charge my buds 2 or 3 times before needing to charge the case again.Buds seem to last longer during phones calls than meetings (thinks zoom) or listening to music (think YouTube).Noise cancellation is good! Especially if listening to something. If using as earplugs, the sound is more muffled than cancelled though.If you don't mind recharging your buds often, I highly recommend. I still highly recommend because the sound is worth every penny and the setup is so easy across multiple devices.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AGEFG6MUBSCIMMLTTJHTJYJEWTMQ,1,3,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

These are not as described. For starters, the sound is tinny and not as rich as others. Even my cheap Raycons have better sound. These also are advertised as having good noise canceling. News flash... they don't have Active Noice Canceling at all!. Even with the largest ear buds on them, and the sound turned relatively high, I can still hear everything around me and there is no setting in the app to activate or adjust ANC. I was going to use these for a while and if they were good, upgrade to the Pro's... but these don't pass muster. Once again, the Raycons come in first place because they have pretty good ANC.Now you may ask ""If the Raycons are so good, why buy these?""The Raycons are push button and when I want to do things like change songs, I have to push the buttons and it pushes them harder into my ears. Also, the call quality suffers because people in the other end can't hear me very well. With these I never got to the part where I tried the call, but there was no point. If I don't like the audio, the call quality won't matter.These are cheaply priced for a reason.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023",AH3DASADOTFMAVMTKHRFGCBEJQYA,1,1,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds

They just feel intuitive and natural. I find them easy to work with. The tap/pause works, and I never have to readjust them, and have my music constantly paused.Battery-These beat the $&@;: out of any earbuds on the market by at least double. I havent tested the battery myself yet, but 8-10 hours is A LOT of music!Sound quality-Google nailed it. The sound quality is at least on par with AirPods. The bass is strong but not overpowering, and the voice and midrange are crystal clear.

Sound is great for a vast majority of users (but not quite audiophile level) and these have great features. The auto pause when you take them of your ear, google assistant and touch buttons, automatic volume control based on ambient noise are all thoroughly enjoyable and helpful. Definitely make sure you download the app to get the most out of them.I do use them for music, videos, voice, and video calls and have great results with Windows, Mac, and Android. Battery life isn't the most stellar and I do run out of juice when using continuously for 3 to 4 hours between music and calls. But at this point I normally find that my ears need a break anyway and the buds charge rapidly in the case so they have enough juice to keep going by the time I'm ready to throw them in again.I also paired the sage color buds with the leather case from Nomad, and the pairing makes this product look and feel like a luxury product.I can't say how happy I am to have such a large company trending towards making modern tech more affordable.

RTTFYIVPAN2JD,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars A great set of Earbuds for a non-premium price,Seth McNew,5,"I was kind of skeptical at first when I decided to buy these - there were other earbuds I was considering at the time at around the same price range, and I had a pair of $20 buds at home that were still somewhat working. But, I decided to take a shot and honestly, I'm really surprised with how well these work.Bluetooth communication between the buds and my Pixel 6 have been amazing outside of one weird incident towards the beginning where music was choppy, but a quick restart on my phone fixed that. I've left my phone in my office a few times, and I can get a pretty good distance before noticing dropouts too, so it's nice not to always need the phone on my hip for these to work. Though, these do not support multipoint - afraid if you want to connect to multiple devices at the same time with a Pixel bud, you'll need to step up to the Pixel Buds Pro.Audio quality has been really good as well. I'm no audiophile by any means, but I do listen to a lot of EDM/Techno/Jazz and nothing really sounds muted. There is a setting to do Bass Boost within the Bluetooth settings that silently get installed when pairing the Buds for the first time to your phone, but I've yet to experiment with it. ANC isn't a feature on here, but just the fit of the earbuds do isolate the music to some degree from the world around. And the fit was surprisingly comfortable - the extra wing of support keeps the buds in place well that I rarely have to adjust them.Lastly, I was kind of worried about the battery before purchasing. I'd prefer something that would last my whole work day, and surprisingly, these do! Mind you, I typically only have a single bud in while I'm working because a lot of people walk into my office, but I'll swap buds around lunch time when it starts to get low on battery. They charge quickly - I'd say I could pull out my bud in about 20 minutes to it being mostly, if not fully charged. From this, I'd say I get about a week's worth of battery charge with the case.My only major complaint is that I hate that there's no tactile buttons on the buds themselves. You have to tap the G on your earbuds to bring up the Assistant, stop/play music, etc. but sometimes I'll be tapping all around the bud just trying to find that sweet spot because touch detection can be a little iffy. But, compared to my previous earbud set, this is a significant upgrade.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AEJOJYUEQYWVBUETOZOM4Q3UCELQ,1,55,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

Great price.What I don't like:The microphone has trouble cancelling out some background noise when used for phone calls.I think it's a great value and they stay in the ear while the pros kept falling out.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AEXJFDHW3W6G3Y6B4IT2WTOJGM3Q,1,0,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds
R34SGUUF15VEJV,B0BZ9WMLNQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Best every day headphones - works with non pixel too,Gary M Gettis,4,"Note: These do not have active noise cancellation! Only the pixel buds 2 have thatI have these and I just purchased them for my wife because I think they're great. I love how subtle they are, and fit almost flush with the ear. I hate earbuds that stick way out of the ear, so these are perfect. And the stabilizer bar keeps them secure. The sound is great and super clear, but the battery life could be better. I seem to get maybe 2 hours of continuous use. However, I only use one headphone at a time, most of the time, so that could be doubled If you were to do that. I feel like I get more charges out of the case than it says in the description as well.They're very easy to connect to any phone. I have a pixel device but my wife does not and her headphones connected right away. I'm also a fan of the features. When you take them out it'll pause music or videos, when you put them back in it'll start playing again. I just wish it had the volume function like the more expensive pixel buds, where you could swipe the volume up and down on the headphone. . Definitely worth the money","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2024",AGM6BQFOVTIDVWICSC2K3ZTPKVOA,1,2,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds

RB54OKL32JRKE,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Wireless Showdown: Pixel Buds in the Ring,Heather A. Turner,5,"Venturing into the realm of the Google Pixel Buds, I embarked on a journey of exploration that spanned across platforms, including iPhone and Windows computer usage. This review aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the capabilities of these wireless earbuds, in comparison to other popular options. To be honest I tried them out because they were on supersale during Prime Day. So why not!The Pixel Buds shine brightly in several aspects. Their design, minimalistic and comfortable, ensures a snug fit suitable for both workouts and daily activities. The sound quality, characterized by crisp audio and punchy bass, impressed me across a variety of musical genres. Google's adaptive sound feature, dynamically adjusting volume based on surroundings, further enhanced the listening experience.As an iPhone user I love Airpods but they are pretty pricey. Speaking of alternatives, let's talk about the AirPods. The Pixel Buds stack up well in terms of sound quality and the real-time translation feature, giving them a distinct edge. I have found the battery to be pretty good and have not had to recharge nearly as often as my Airpod Pros.Considering the AirPods, while they integrate seamlessly with Apple devices, the Pixel Buds' compatibility with different platforms is a plus. Additionally, the Pixel Buds' noise canceling and translation capabilities broaden their appeal beyond audio quality alone.To sum it up, the Google Pixel Buds offer a solid package. Their design, audio quality, and innovative features position them as strong contenders in the wireless earbud market. Though a few minor drawbacks exist, they deliver an enjoyable audio journey. Whether you lean towards the Google ecosystem or seek versatile wireless earbuds with modern touches, the Pixel Buds are well worth your consideration. So I say, if they are on SUPERSALE give them a spin!","Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2023",AECN7SQ3TVCMIAG2JRVPSNGZE5WQ,1,61,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds

R3S40TUBFPM6RV,B0BZ9WMLNQ,3.0 out of 5 stars These are marginally good,Signalsoldier,3,"When they work, they work well. Here are a list of my complaints- The stay connected to the phone after placing them in the pod. The contact sensors may not be extended far enough from the inside of the case to contact the earphones to disconnect and charge. I often have to press them firmly into their holes before closing the lid.- They often take forever to connect after pulling them from the case. Sometimes not at all. You have to place them inside, close the lid and reopen and pull them out several times before they connect.- They've gotten lower in sound over time. After about 30 days the left bud is noticeably lower than the right. For seemingly no reason.I've had 3 different set of Pixel buds and they've all fell victim to the above complaints. Keep this in mind if you plan to buy some","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AHD4VRSBQKF3IBX2RJJCKZN2EJFQ,1,6,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds
RQX6424R8MXGA,B0BZ9WMLNQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding but limited performance,fernando,4,"From the reviews and price I was on the fence. I decided to bite the bullet and buy these mostly because of the price and that they are Google like my 7 pro. I've had several buds favorite being a pair of Bose that are discontinued, sounded great connected easily and after several years and my sweat , maybe not cleaning them better, they are pretty beat up. Still working but controls have fallen off hahah. Ok back to the review, issues trying to hang up a call , can't ever tell unless I'm staring at my cell, should have some sort of confirmation sound or something.Additionally, Not having a separate app for them is where I feel it's a unfulfilling and limited experience. You can't tailor the sound, they are not very loud; obviously buds would not be safe to use if too loud but my other buds both Bose still sound better only slightly because the difference in volume, the Google buds do shine when talking fidelity. I have some other less known over the head headphones and earbuds by Soundcore which sounds good but these are super clear just no adjustments. I download an equalizer app which helps.I can live with most of these small shortcomings since they were not very expensive but for 100 dollars I would have like better controls , better fit. I have the same fit issues as other reviews have mentioned. I don't like over the ear buds with the little accessories to hold in place so I stick with this type. The other ones I have which are the Bose beat up and all from sweat and the Soundcore earbuds fit much better. Google little case is annoying too, should have come with a little cord to secure the charging case or at least a less slippery material for the surface, Im always feeling I'm going to lose it at the gym or anywhere. Still think of returning them but trying to work with them cause although the are not very loud they do sound great. Battery life still have not used enough ,earbuds weight would probably help if they were a bit heavier would help with fit and about range, not too sure yet.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AEU2OFD3HFVEF4LXEUMV4TJ6GQLA,1,1,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds
R3GF0ZH41I5UZW,B0BZ9WMLNQ,4.0 out of 5 stars everything about them,Bhaldeman4231,4,i mean they're nice for the connection to my google pixel. It's really the only reason i bought them. as far as sound quality goes i would give them a 6 out of 10 stars. Once you turn the bass up in the settings it sounds like crap. But they fit well and work well. Really the sound quality when listening to music is the only thing so far I have to complain about,"Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AFHBY6MNM3JBNT7L25MH72DXXFGQ,1,0,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds
